i'm sorry for the delay.
we were with the members of the bar this morning because there's a new canteen
and it's a long pending demand of the bar you know.
there was no canteen in the abc complex. the additional building complex. i just wish
to point out to your lordships that i have filed that written submission additional.
it is in volume eight at pages twenty eight to thirty.
just your lordship may note there, the judgments.
volume eight?
volume eight, page twenty eight to thirty.
yes. grateful. thank you.
thank you, mister patwalia. my lords, yesterday, when my lords had risen, i had finished
point six.
your lordships, have my note?
it's two (c), now, volume two (c) it's been uploaded.
yes, two (c).
my lord, the chief justice has two (c)?
yes. point six, i had concluded by showing your lordship that section fourteen (two) of
the lokpal act, which reproduces effectively section one hundred and five and its import.
so, whatever is the interpretation that your lordships give here will have an impact there
as well.
sorry. my lords have it?
volume two (c)?
just display it.
i don't know if it.
because it's interactive as well, the note so.
it's interactive as well, so it will be helpful.
my lords, there are two judgments on point seven.
point seven is, it is established that a strict interpretation ought to be given to
laws dealing with corruption which affects the public wheel.
before i take your lordships to that para five at page eleven and maybe before
it gets uploaded on justice sundresh's system, i could take your lordships to volume eight.
there are two judgments which i had alluded to yesterday in the context of section
one hundred and ninety seven of the crpc, that was, of course, on the question
of sanction, but obviously a similar interpretation would apply between a sanction which is a
lower bar and an immunity, which is much higher.
it's at page thirty one of volume eight, it's hori ram singh versus the crown
volume eight, page thirty one.
all your lordships have that?
now this was dealing with a situation where one mister henderson had conspired before he
fled to britain to cheat the government out of certain payments that had to be
made and he falsified entries, etcetera.
interestingly, it was argued by the sir brojendra mitter, advocate general of india, before the
federal court. his portrait hangs in my friend, the attorney general's chambers. if your lordship
will just come immediately to justice varadachariar whose judgment everybody else agrees with which is
at page fifty five.
how do we take judicial notice of the portrait which hangs in the attorney general's
chambers?
no, it's just that because i, in fact, had visited the chambers when his predecessor
was there.
and we had the names of all the previous attorney generals with their portraits.
and there were two portraits without names below, which were the two advocates general for
india that we had prior to.
so, one was brojendra mitter, i think the other gentleman's name i have forgotten but
the names are not there.
maybe that can be repaired.
page one hundred and eighty seven, because one hundred and eighty three is where the
majority starts.
just if your lordships can come to page one hundred and eighty, page.
i'm sorry.
i should have read the other page.
what's the pdf page. fifty nine.
sorry, page fifty nine, my lord. pdf is fifty nine.
yes. at the bottom that paragraph, if i can just read that the reported decisions
on the application of section one hundred and ninety seven of the crpc are not
by any means uniform.
in most of them the actual conclusion will probably be found to be unexceptionable in
view of the facts of each case.
but in some the test has been laid down in terms which it is difficult
to accept as exhaustive or correct.
much the same may be said even of decisions pronounced in england on the language
of similar statutory provisions.
see observations in.
it does not seems to be necessary to review in detail the decisions given under
one hundred and ninety seven of the crpc, which may roughly be classified as falling
into three groups.
so far as they attempted to state something in the nature of a test.
in one group of cases, it is insisted that there must be something in the
nature of the act complained of that attaches it to the official character of the
person doing, judgments are cited.
in another group, more stress has been laid on the circumstance that the official character
or status of the accused gave him the opportunity to commit the offense.
it seems to me that the first is the correct view.
in the third group of cases, stress is laid almost exclusively on the fact that
it was at a time when the accused was engaged in his official duty that
the alleged offense was said to have been committed.
the use of the expression while acting, etcetera., in one hundred and ninety seven has
been held to lend some support to this view.
while i do not wish to ignore the significance of the time factor, it does
not seem to me right to make it the test.
to take an illustration suggested in the course of the argument, if a medical officer
while on duty in the hospital is alleged to have committed rape on one of
the patients, or to have stolen a jewel from the patient's person, it is difficult
to believe that it was the intention of the legislature that he could not be
prosecuted for such offenses, except with the previous sanction of the local government.
two reported decisions these are from the high courts of madras and calcutta, one in
ganapathy goundan under one hundred and ninety seven and the other dakshina ranjan ghose under
eighty of the cpc may be referred to as instructive, since in each of them
two acts were complained of, and notwithstanding the apparent connection between the acts in the
sense of relation in time or opportunity.
the court held that one of the acts was an official act, but not the
other.
in the madras case, the village magistrate held in confinement certain persons who are suspected
to have committed a murder, and also tortured them in order to extort a confession
from them.
he was charged for committing offenses under three hundred and thirty, three hundred and forty
three and three hundred and forty eight of the ipc. wallace, j. held that, sanction
to prosecute him under sections three hundred forty three and three hundred forty eight was
required under one hundred ninety seven of the crpc, but not for prosecuting him under
three hundred thirty.
in the calcutta case, a trader sued a police officer for recovery of two sums
of money, namely r's fifty being damages for wrongful arrest, and r's seventy five being
the amount alleged to have been extorted by the police officer from the plaintiff. as
regards the second head of claim, the learned judges were of opinion that no notice
on the eighty of the cpc was necessary, as nobody could suppose that he was
purporting to act in his official capacity in demanding and obtaining the sum of r's
seventy five.
just one quick follow up, which, my lords, is at page sixty five.
this is satwant singh. it's in nineteen sixty.
it's page sixty from the same volume.
again, five judges' judgment, where just one paragraph if i can read, which is para
sixteen, at page seventy, bottom of page seventy.
if i can read that, para sixteen.
'under section one hundred and ninety seven, no court shall take cognizance of an offense
committed by a public servant who is removable from his office by the governor general
council or a provincial government, save upon a sanction by one or another, as the
case may be when such offense is committed by him, while acting or purporting the
act in the discharge of his official duty.
henderson was charged with intentionally aiding the appellant in the commission of an offense punishable
under four hundred and twenty of the indian penal code, by falsely stating as a
fact in his reports, that the appellant's claims were true, and that statement had been
made knowing all the while, that the claims in question were false and fraudulent, and
that it accordingly committed an offense under four hundred twenty, one hundred nine of the
indian penal code'.
'it appears to us'.
please mark this, to be clear, 'that some offenses cannot, by their very nature, be
regarded as having been committed by public servants while acting or purporting to act in
the discharge of the official duty.
for instance, acceptance of a bribe, an offense punishable under one hundred and sixty one
of the ipc’, at that time my lord, before the prevention of corruption. 'is one
of them, and the offense of cheating or abetment thereof is another.
we have no hesitation saying that when a public servant commits the offense of cheating
or abets another so to cheat, the offense committed by him is not one while
he is acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, as
such offenses have no necessary connection between them, and the performance of the duties of
a public servant, the official status, furnishing only the occasion or opportunity for the commission
of the offense.
the act of cheating or abetment thereof, has no reasonable connection with the discharge of
official duty.
the act must bear such relation to the duty that the public servant could lay
a reasonable, but not a pretended or fanciful claim that he did it in the
course of the performance of his duties vide matajog dobey'.
now, if your lordships will come back to my note two (c), now this position
has been consistent in the prakash singh badal and elsewhere.
over seventy years, your lordships, eighty years your lordships have followed this kind of reasoning
as far as sanction is concerned.
now, the reason why i'm showing this parallel.
the reason i'm showing this parallel, is to commend to your lordships to fairly nuanced
points.
one is this, that even the minority which we are relying on of narasimha rao,
there might be one or two things your lordships may just look at again, because
i would not believe that that is the correct position.
some aspects of the minority itself.
so, rather than embracing the minority in full, there are some aspects which may require
some kind of clarity, including that 'arising out of', whether you don't give a vote
or a speech, those aspects may require some clarity.
but, the second aspect is this, that when you interpret the entire cloak of one
hundred and five, and the immunity that it gives, some distinction has to be made
between the various types of activities.
now, in the recent judgment, which we had referred to yesterday also in ajith, there
was a distinction drawn between what are the legislative and non-legislative functions.
now, it is similar to what virtually every other jurisprudence that we could find, comparatively,
has similar approaches with what is essential, what is part of your duties, and where
immunity could lie, and where it clearly doesn't and it can't be a part of.
now, if your lordship considers a scenario, for example, because this immunity attends not only
proceedings in parliament, but also before committees.
now, those who are appearing before the committees, for example, are not only mp's and
mla's; they may be experts, they may be advocates, they may be people from civil
society who have to weigh in for example, on an environment bill.
or, if there is an inquiry into ethnic violence somewhere, and parliament has a standing
committee set up and people are coming in to make their statements.
now, if an mp or an mla, who is somebody who may be affected by
that committee's findings against him or her, were to threaten or intimidate or, in any
way detain, for example, that witness who's supposed to appear before parliament, now those are
all questions where the mp or mla may say, this immunity is available to me,
because it's with reference to a proceeding of parliament. so it shouldn't be that that
cloak is available to that gentleman or that lady for that purpose.
that is not the intention.
the intention is that the minute it is a criminal act, that criminal act, can
only be immune if it is very directly related to the speech that is made
or the vote that is given.
it has to be direct, it has to be proximate, in every sense of the
term it has to be there.
so, for that proximity to be obtained in a situation where i threaten or disable
an individual from taking the legislative process forward, that is very proximate, because without that
the outcome may have been different.
if i detain the balancing vote in parliament on a particular issue which may require
a bye-election to take place, or a fresh election to take place, whatever else it
is.
and i detain the person who's going to give the balancing vote in his house.
i am interfering with the legislative process because if i had not done that, that
person would have come and cast that vote.
similarly, if i had not detained the witness or intimidated the witness, the witness would
have appeared before the parliamentary committee and made his intervention.
so those are very proximate and the test, i would suggest, is to see the
consequence or the effect of that act.
if that.
i'm sorry.
yes, my lord. to speak about the connectivity and context is one thing.
and reformulating the scope and extent of the immunity is another thing.
so what you are now suggesting as against till now what the arguments were, was
that the crime was before the occurrence of the immunity.
so, therefore it can be bifurcated.
now you would want us to also give certain conditions on the basis of which
this scope of immunity is to be measured.
yes, my lord because.
.
gets into a little difficulty.
i'll explain the reason why.
because before seven judges, these are not adversarial issues.
these are issues that we all must be nuanced about.
one of the contra arguments, which is taken regularly not only in this jurisdiction but
elsewhere, is that if you have a powerful executive and that powerful executive can then
go after legislators and disable legislators, if the legislators don't have the protective cloak.
so, when you are balancing this, you have to be careful of ensuring that the
legislators gets the immunity that the constitution intended, that we can't run away from.
we shouldn't make the cloak so small that it disappears.
so, if we are doing that, we have to have some kind of formulation or
test on the basis of which we will say this immunity, i think, is fair
and it is deserved.
now, if.
and the immunity obviously will arise, as mister ramachandran said yesterday, only when the crime
is there, because if there is no crime, there is no question of the immunity.
the immunity is there is a crime, and then there is a question of immunity.
so, we take it that there is a crime, but what sort of crime.
so, the test here is to see what that sort of crime is.
because otherwise, if there's no crime, there is no immunity.
the crime which we are dealing with is a crime which attends a speech that
is given or as i argue, not given a vote that is given or not
given as a consequence of something that is extraneous.
there the cloak will not arise, if it is in the normal legislative process.
unfortunately, your lordships have seen a live example of this two weeks ago, when i
don't know the phrase parliamentary language can be used anymore after what took place.
but we saw expletives being thrown around in parliament. the gentleman who threw those expletives
around parliament took care of ensuring that those words were struck off the record, but
what took place was a crime, it's my view.
my view is that what took place was a crime.
it's many hues of hate speech, and many provisions of the ipc would be attracted.
but whether we like it or not, palatable or not, it is something he said
during a debate and he said it on a subject.
i don't think it would be fair for us to say that that gentleman, however
reprehensible his conduct may have been did not have privilege when he said that.
so, an action for criminal defamation will not lie on the basis of the speech?
no, in my view very clearly no.
and that's what we're seeing, our hands are tied.
obviously we find this repulsive.
but our hands are tied and the court's hands are unfortunately tied, because that is
the deference that we give to the parliamentary process.
it was not germane.
but if your lordships were to embark on that inquiry, on whether that word you
said, this sentence that crept in was germane to that debate or not then we
are treading on dangerous territory.
i don't think we should be going that far, examining a speech in a particular
context and saying that these two sentences from the speech is actually constituting something else.
but that's international position.
case to case basis.
i'm sorry.
perhaps is to go case to case basis.
it's very difficult to lay down a proposition saying that far, no further.
no, no, i agree.
how can the court say that well this was the speech, these offending words, which
you used were unnecessary for the speech.
that's not a part of the court's obligation, or duty.
we expect responsible parliament and parliamentarians to take much more stringent action.
that's what we expect.
we have come to expect.
i'm not normally a conservative, but i feel that this is something that your lordship
may look at.
now, i'll just come back to the note quickly.
if your lordships will just come to point number seven, which is at page two
and if you'll just tap on that see para five, at page eleven, just quickly,
the very relevant extracts are there.
this is page eleven.
my lord justice sundresh has the note?
page eleven.
the first one under five is the subramanian swamy case that was under section. i'm
sorry page eleven of volume two (c).
it's on the screen also.
i got it.
so, this is in the context of section six a of the delhi special police
establishment act. what was struck down in vineet narain is a single directive.
the section provided an additional layer of protection to certain classes of officers, etcetera., and
these are the observations of a unanimous constitution bench there.
para fifty nine, 'irrespective of their status or position, corrupt public servants are corruptors of
public power.
the corrupt public servants whether high or low are birds of the same feather and
must be confronted with the process of investigation and inquiry equally.
based on the position or status and service, no distinction can be made between public
servants against whom there are allegations amounting to an offense under the pc act'.
next para, only the underlined portion, 'there is no rational basis to classify the two
sets of public servants differently on the ground that one set of officers are decision
making officers and not the other set of officers.
if there is an accusation of bribery, graft, illegal gratification or criminal misconduct against a
public servant, then we fail to understand as to how the status of offenders is
of any relevance.
where there are allegations against a public servant should amount to an offense under the
pc act, no factor pertaining to expertise of decision making is involved.
yet, section six a makes a distinction.
it is this vice which renders six a violative of article fourteen '.
then page twelve, para.
seventy two, the bold portion.
'the status or position of public servant does not qualify such public servant from exemption
from equal treatment'.
the dissent of justice pasayat in rameshwar prasad, 'but after getting elected, if the candidate
deviates from the course of fairness and purity and becomes a purchasable commodity, he not
only betrays the electorate'.
that trust which we had discussed yesterday.
'but also pollutes the pure stream of democracy'.
if your lordships will come back to the top.
just back to top at the top of each page.
so, if your lordship just comes back, it'll take you back to the note.
next proposition, that's proposition eight, that's on page three.
the effect of the rao majority is that it creates an illegitimate class of public
servants that are afforded an extraordinary protection, which would be a violation of article fourteen
as also being manifest manifestly arbitrary.
if your lordship will tap that, it'll take you to page thirteen.
my lords, at the end of each of these extracts in pages seven, i mean
pages five to eighteen.
some hyperlinks have not come out.
dekh lo hyperlinks kyun nahi aa rahe hain the hyperlinks are not coming on that?
aapke mein aa raha hai na?
my lords, it's not coming on any of yours?
it's coming?
that's okay, i'll check it out.
yes, item eight, no?
yes. point eight?
yes, page thirteen, i was on.
yes. yes, from eight, if you go, it will take you to page thirteen.
top of page thirteen‘creating a class of public servants, mp's, mla's, within the broad class
of public servants, is a violation of article fourteen’.
there's the‘super citizens’ which even brewster refers to and narasimha rao refers to.
justice khanna in indira gandhi,‘this court rejected that contention, and held that the true constitutional
position, is that so far as the valid order of detention is concerned, a member
of parliament can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen, and
that he is as much liable to be arrested and detained under it as any
other citizen’.
in the special courts bill, my lords, justice chandrachud speaking for the majority, at para
four, the underlined portion again.
‘it only means that all persons, similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike, both in privileges
conferred and liabilities imposed.
equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation, and there
should be no discrimination between one person and another, if as regards the subject matter
of the legislation, their position is substantially the same’.
and finally, this lokayukta, justice ripusudan dayal, the small, the bold portion there.
‘the basic premise for the privileges enjoyed by the members, is to allow them to
perform their functions as members, and no hindrance is caused to the functioning of the
house. the committee of privilege of the tenth lok sabha noted the main arguments that
have been advanced in favour of codification, some of which are follows’.
and this extract,‘the basic law that all citizens should be treated equally before the law,
holds good in the case of members of parliament as well.
they have the same rights and liberties as ordinary citizens, except when they perform their
duties in parliament. the privileges therefore, do not in any way, exempt members from their
normal obligation to society, which apply to them as much, and perhaps more closely, in
that as they apply to others’.
and the next page, that last bold line.
‘no one enjoys any privilege against criminal prosecution.’ now, this is a consistent position that
your lordships have adopted.
final point is,‘the legal position in usa, uk, canada, australia, south africa, and new zealand,
supports the minority opinion of rao, and the same is commended before this court's consideration.
this includes an undisturbed line of cases following the majority decision in brewster’.
if your lordships were to see at page fourteen, the extracts, the first is the
united states, and this we have.
the extract is there of article one, section one, clause one, which is known as
the speech and debates clause, that, 'the senators and representatives shall be privileged for any
speech or debate in either house. they shall not be questioned in any other place’.
the full language of it, my lords will find in that relevant annexure, annexure-eleven.
but, the relevant parts of daniel b. brewster in the majority opinion, are these bold
portions, i'll just read small parts of it.
‘a legislative act has consistently been defined as an act generally done in congress in
relation to the business before it’.
next,‘in no case has this court ever treated the clause as protecting all conduct relating
to the legislative process’.
third one,‘but no more than the statutes apply, was its purpose to make members of
congress super citizens immune from criminal responsibility’.
this is where the phrase‘super citizens’ comes.
and the next one, which is not bold but relevant, para fifty.
‘the sweeping claims appellee would render members of congress virtually immune from a wide range
of crimes, simply because acts in question were peripherally related to their holding office.
such claims are inconsistent with the reading this court has given, not only to the
speech or debate clause, but also to the other legislative privileges embodied in article one,
para six’.
next page, page fifteen,‘there is no need for the government to show this’.
para. sixty two.
‘there's no need for the government to show that appellee fulfilled the alleged illegal bargain.
acceptance of the bribe is the violation of the statute, not performance of the illegal
promise’, similar to us.
‘taking a bribe is obviously no part of the legislative process or function.
it is not a legislative act’.
my lord, this is followed in the judgments of gravel, mcdade, renzi, and the extract
here.
and menendez. here we have taken out the extracts only of gravel and menendez. the
entire details you'll find in annexure eleven.
white's opinions, speaking for the court in gravel is,‘legislative acts are not all encompassing.
the heart of the clause is speech or debate in either house. insofar as the
clause is construed to reach other matters, they must be an integral part of the
deliberative and communicative processes by which members participate in committee and house proceedings with respect
to the consideration in passage, or rejection of proposed legislation, or with respect to other
matters which the constitution places within the jurisdiction of either house. while the speech or
debate clause recognizes speech, voting and other legislative acts as exempt from liability that might
otherwise attach, it does not privilege either senator or aid, to violate an otherwise valid
criminal law in preparing or implementing legislative acts’.
now, brewster has been consistently followed in the us. the latest case is this twenty
sixteen, which is menendez. and there are these two paragraphs, specific sentences.
opinion of the court of justice.
'first, we look to the form of the act to determine whether it is inherently
legislative or non-legislative.
some acts are so clearly legislative in nature that no further examination is to be
made to determine the appropriate status.
examples of manifestly legislative acts include introducing and voting on proposed resolutions and legislation, introducing
evidence and interrogating witnesses during committee hearings, subpoenaing records for committee hearings, inserting material into
congressional record, and delivering a speech in congress. on the other side of the spectrum
some acts are so clearly non-legislative there are no inquiry into the content or underlying
motivation or purpose is needed to classify them.
examples include legitimate constituent service, such as the making of appointments, government agencies, assistance in
securing government contracts, preparing so called newsletters to constituents, news releases, and speeches delivered outside
the congress and of course illegitimate activities, such as accepting bribes in exchange for taking
official action.
this is echoed, my lords, in your lordship's judgment in ajith. and i would commend
that this be the test that your lordships will apply.
that if it is an illegitimate.
your lordships can see the three categories here which the us supreme court has adopted.
one is, manifestly legislative acts, the second are clearly non-legislative and the third is illegitimate
activities.
what narasimha rao's majority has done is taken illegitimate activities and said no, even they
received the cloak of protection and i don't think that was intended.
my lords, the rest of it is, i'm sorry, bottom of page sixteen.
sixteen deals with the uk, just the joint committee on parliamentary privilege. this is a
report of ' thirteen -' fourteen.
if i can just read the bold portion, 'requesting or agreeing to receive a bribe
are now statutory criminal offenses irrespective of whether or not the acts for which the
bribe was sought or offered were actually carried out'.
this makes the situation in the united kingdom analogous to that in the united states,
where the case of us versus brewster established that a senator could be prosecuted by
demonstrating that an unlawful agreement was entered into, without the need to show that the
bribe led to specific conduct which may be privileged.
similar views in australia, in canada. in canada, my friend, the amicus read r versus
bunting. we have also extracted the criminal codes in each of these countries.
and for a minute, if your lordships would just go to, sorry, annexure-eight, which is
page one hundred and twelve.
i'm not going to read it.
i'm just going to explain how we have split it up.
page one hundred and twelve, that's annexure-eight.
annexure-eight, your lordships will that first page, page one hundred and twelve deals with united
states. so, we have put the statute, the relevant statute or the clause of the
constitution at the top and the relevant clauses of other related laws, then the case
name on left, the facts and the extracts of the opinions, majority, minority, whatever is
relevant, including highlighting in red what we would want your lordships to consider.
in this light before concluding.
i just want your lordships to look at and there are others to argue, so
i'll just mention the paras.
in narasimha rao, if your lordships will kindly just see para forty five, forty seven,
fifty and fifty two.
now, these are parts of the majority judgment, sorry, minority judgment.
forty five deals with the fact that a punishment by the house is not satisfactory.
forty six is the interpretation of 'in respect of'.
forty seven deals with the question of the vote or the speech already having been
cast and the question of something already having taken place is only where the words
can be read as 'arising out of', where it has already taken place.
there is one small issue there, if your lordship sees page seven hundred and fifty
two, page seven hundred and fifty two, volume five.
i'm sorry.
volume five, page seven hundred and fifty two.
last sentence there on that page, which is part of para forty seven.
if i may read that, 'the immunity'.
or the second last sentence, four lines up, 'the immunity from liability, therefore, comes into
play only if a speech has been made or vote has been given.
the immunity would not be available in a case where a speech has not been
made or a vote has not been given'.
i would feel that this is problematic and this would not be the correct position,
despite it being in the minority.
then the next page deals with that distinction and how our founding fathers did not
mean for a distinction between what eventually took place between those who voted and those
who did not vote in a specific fashion.
and para fifteen deals with when the offense is complete because that aspect was also
considered.
and para fifty two says that the criminal liability for taking the bribe was independent
completely.
these other paragraphs which i've mentioned, i think should be the correct position and should
be followed, my lords. if your lordships, could just now come to the judgment in
ajith which is in volume five, starts at page twenty six eighty, my lord. twenty
six eighty and i just want to read two specific parts of it.
the first is para seventy four to seventy five, which is at page twenty seven
oh four, volume five, page twenty seven oh four.
may i read that?
all your lordships have that?
volume?
para?
para seventy four, page twenty seven oh four.
yes. 'privileges and immunities are not gateways to claim exemptions from the general law of
the land, particularly as in this case the criminal law which governs the action of
every citizen.
to claim an exemption from the application of criminal law, would be to betray the
trust which is impressed on the character of elected representatives as the makers and enactors
of law.
the entire foundation upon which the application for withdrawal under three hundred and twenty one
was moved by the public prosecutor is based on a fundamental misconception of the constitutional
provisions contained in one hundred ninety four.
the public prosecutor seems to have been impressed by the existence of privileges and immunities
which would stand in the way of the prosecution.
such an understanding betrays the constitutional provision and proceeds on a misconception that elected members
of the legislature stand above the general application of criminal law'.
the reliance placed by the appellants on pv narasimha rao to argue that the action
of the respondent accused inside the house was a form of protest, which bears a
close nexus to the freedom of speech and thus is covered by one hundred ninety
four is unsatisfactory.
the majority in narasimha rao dealt with the interpretation of the phrase 'in respect of'
and gave it a wide import.
at the same time, the majority observed that there must be a nexus between the
act or incident, which in that case was the act of bribery in the context
of votes cast in the motion of no-confidence and the freedom of speech or to
vote.
it was emphasized that the bribe was given to manipulate the votes of the mp's,
and thus it bore a closed nexus to the freedom protected under article one hundred
five (two).
the case, however, did not deal with the ambit of the privilege of freedom of
speech provided to the members of the house. it was in lokayukta justice ripusudan dayal
that a three judge bench of this court laid down the law for the identification
of the content of the privileges.
it was held that the members shall only possess such privileges that are essential, please
mark this, my lords, for undertaking their legislative functions.
an alleged act of destruction of public property within the house by the members to
lodge the protest against the presentation of the budget cannot be regarded as essential for
exercising their legislative functions.
the actions of the members have trodden past the line of constitutional means and is
thus not covered by the privileges guaranteed under the constitution. so this is a test
which i would commend, my lord. the fact that it has to be essential for
undertaking the legislative function.
it's a better test than the test of proximity of in time or that the
vote or speech is already completed.
the question is only whether while giving that speech or casting that vote, was it
a part of the essential legislative function, which was done.
if it was done, you have the protection.
but if there is any interference with that flow of what the wheels of parliament
or legislature are undertaking, if there is any interference of any sort that cloak cannot
come to protect.
that protection would not be available.
i'll just finally say one thing.
there is an article by professor shubhankar dam which is annexed, my lords. ordinance. i'm
sorry he's written a book on ordinance.
he's written a book on ordinance.
i cited it, i think in my judgment in krishna kumar singh. yes. so, he
in fact, has written a series of very, very well researched articles, including on the
constitutional right to vote, and whether it's a constitutional right or not, etcetera.
but this one is specifically with reference.
it makes for an interesting reading, especially i think if you're a judge, because he
talks in.
like how many writers write about philosophies in the us. same way, he talks about
narasimha rao and raja ram pal and the philosophies which attended them.
where is that article?
see the page numbers.
it's nineteen fifty one of volume six.
nineteen fifty one to nineteen fifty three.
nineteen fifty one to nineteen fifty three, is where narasimha rao is discussed, and he
says how, perhaps, the supreme court had a revisiting of its philosophy between narasimha rao
and between raja ram pal. my lords, i’m done.
i would just believe that the minority lays down the correct law.
i'm grateful for a patient hearing.
two points of gratitude, quickly.
two points of quick gratitude.
one, i have a very able team of lawyers who’ve put all of this together,
i'm sum of their parts.
so, tanya, vishal, janvi, trisha, shivani and aditi. and mister ramachandran, because he repeatedly stands
in this court and takes completely difficult cases, and somehow makes arguments out of them.
he's an example to all of us at the at the bar my lord. i'm
most grateful.
i support the second part.
yes, my lord, we are.
.
yesterday, he did a very good job.
in a rough weather, my lord. and unpopular cases.
correct. yes, mister hansaria. my lord, my submissions your lordships will get it in volume
two (a), page forty seven.
volume two (a), page forty seven, my submissions start.
but before i take your lordships to the submissions, may i just briefly summarize what
i intend to persuade your lordships, to agree with the minority view, to say that,
my lord, justice bharucha, the test propounded is the nexus test.
and justice agrawal propounded essential and integral part test.
my lord, this nexus test is in paragraph one hundred and thirty three, one hundred
and thirty four, one hundred and thirty five, one hundred and thirty six and one
hundred and forty five of narasimha rao judgment.
one hundred and thirty three, one hundred and thirty four?
one hundred and thirty three, one hundred and thirty four, one hundred and thirty five,
one hundred and thirty six and one hundred and forty five, is the nexus test
propounded and held to be the correct law by the majority.
and, my lord, justice agrawal’s test was essential and integral part test, in para forty
seven, which my friend mister sankaranarayanan also said, essential and integral part test would be
the correct test.
and, your lordships would kindly make a note, it is not only bribery, it will.
justice agrawal is para forty six, no?
para forty seven, my lord, i’m so sorry.
i’m so sorry.
para forty seven is the essential and integral part test.
and what your lordship says is not only in relation to an offense of prevention
of corruption act, it gives immunity to all sorts of crimes committed, if at all.
hopefully not, my lord. suppose, there is a nexus with an underground organization, terrorist organization,
to vote in a particular manner.
there is a meeting on a previous day, and say that.
a terrorist organisation says you don't vote or vote in a particular manner.
it has a nexus.
if nexus theory is accepted, my lord, that immunity is applicable to an offense under
the uapa act also.
that immunity is available to an offense under the pmla act also, or various other
acts.
so, my lord, to say that only the bribery issues involved, what your lordships would
say, would involve all crimes, which.
unfortunately we have the list of more than five thousand cases pending against the legislators
in the country, and it is not a stray incident of one or two cases
my lord, which has come to your lordships in narasimha rao or in this case.
with that preface, may i just humbly meet the four submissions which my learned friend
mister ramachandran made my lord, and take your lordships to my written submissions thereafter.
the first test.
the first submission which my learned friend, mister ramachandran said, that it had stood by
the test of time, narasimha rao judgment, my lord, which is not correct.
your lordships have repeatedly doubted it, and mister sankaranarayanan had dealt with that aspect.
i don't want to give it.
if mistake is there, it must not be perpetuated.
that is what your lordships have held.
the second is more disturbing.
my learned friend says that 'corruption is a way of life in our political spectrum',
accept it my lord, which my lord, cannot be done.
'aaya ram, gaya ram' has been there since nineteen sixty seven.
it is there, it was there and it will be there.
so, turn a blind eye to this my lord, which i would commend your lordships
to say, to interpret the privilege in a manner which will not flourish the criminality
among the politicians or the political class.
it will, my lord, curb the criminalization of politics and it will not surge it.
an interpretation your lordships would give.
so, that's saying that you accept the reality and the court should turn a blind
eye my lord, that yes, it will be there, it was there.
it's not a correct proposition of law.
because, my lord, i will give you the facts which is there in the.
on record available to the court, that how many cases are there?
we have cases more than the parliamentarians or the legislators in the country.
we have total four thousand seven hundred and seventy eight lawmakers in the country, all
mla's, all mp's, both houses and we have more than five thousand cases against the
politicians my lord, pending in the courts as on date.
so, could your lordships say, all those, all that the person has to say, i
have.
this offense has a nexus with what i have done in the house. nexus theory
is sufficient to exclude him from the criminal liability.
that interpretation would go against the constitutional ethos my lord, against the constitutional morality which
i have developed in my written submissions.
my learned friend also says, that the justice agrawal said it's not a satisfactory solution.
the court is not there to satisfy the solution.
it is the parliament which will deal it.
and my learned friend gave five examples since nineteen forty seven till twenty twenty three,
where parliamentarians have been expelled for some time.
my lord, is it a substitute?
we know these offenses have been there and my lord, for five occasions it has
been expelled for, say, five days, ten days, fifteen days, a month.
thereafter, he comes back as a member of parliament. but if he's convicted in a
criminal offense my lord, he cannot come back.
and as on date, my lord, till six years of the release, he does not
come back.
he cannot contest the election.
so, he cannot continue to be a parliamentarian.
but, if those five instances is the sufficient exercise of power by the legislature or
the house, my lord, which, as mister sankaranarayanan said, we expected much more, my lord.
it has not happened, so it has to be taken into consideration that is not
a satisfactory solution, as observed by my lord, justice agrawal. and finally, my learned friend
says, there's an apprehension of misuse.
apprehension of misuse is being said by a person who has taken one point five
crore to vote in a house, in an election.
and there is a sufficient safeguard, there's a sanction is required for prosecution by the
chairman and the speaker, my lord. where is the question of a frivolous prosecution?
you require a sanction of the chairman of the rajya sabha. you require the sanction
of the speaker of the rajya sabha. so, there is a sufficient safeguard against any
apprehended misuse of any provisions, my lord. with this preface, my lord, may i request
your lordships, to kindly come to volume two (a) para, page forty seven.
the first two pages are regarding issues involved.
your lordship has already considered it at great length.
at page forty nine, it is submitted that.
my lords have got it?
yes that the constitution must be interpreted having regard to the challenges and evolution over
a period of time and must reflect the hopes and aspirations of the people.
it is not a frozen document, which i have borrowed it from your lordship's judgment.
i'll just quoted it subsequently and must be interpreted to meet exigencies of time.
my lord, justice chandrachud as your lordship then was in puttaswamy held, the interpretation of
the constitution cannot be frozen by original understanding, which is sought to be conversed and
constitution has evolved and must continuously evolve to meet the aspirations and challenges of the
present and future, nor can the judges foresee every challenge and contingency which may arise
in future.
but we never foresee my lord, that so many persons with criminal background would come
to the august house of parliament, my lord. but this is what has happened.
so, it has to be in that context.
then, in kalpana mehta, the chief justice deepak mishra said, 'constitution being an organic document,
an ongoing interpretation is permissible.
the supremacy of the constitution is essential to bring changes.
then, while doing so, the constitutional courts are not only required to take into account
their own experience over time, international treaties and covenant, but also keep the doctrine of
flexibility in mind'.
and my lord, justice chandrachud has said my lord in the same judgment in finding
an answer to the question in reference, this question must of necessary travel from a
literal and perhaps superficial approach to an understanding of the essence of what the constitution
seeks to achieve.
at one level, our constitution the power of political power from a your lordship may
skip over that.
and last three lines of page fifty of our interpretation of the constitution must reflect
a keen sense of awareness of the basic changes of the constitution has been made
to the polity and to its governance.
a five judge bench in dawoodi bohra community has laid emphasis that the constitution must
be interpreted as a living instrument considering the changes in the society.
my lord, justice oka has held in that judgment, my lord, para twenty five 'while
interpreting the constitutional provision, we must remember that the constitution is a living instrument, the
organized interpretation rendered by the provisions of the constitution decades back cannot continue to be
valid for all times to come, if the constitution is to continue as a living
instrument with continued relevance.
in view of what we have stated above, the role of the constitutional court to
interpret the constitution, considering changing need of the society assume importance.
in the light of the aforesaid pronunciation by this court'.
yes, all these eleven pages are given.
i have filed this before the compilation was available.
so, i have not linked that, my lord. maybe i'll give it to the court
master, because these are in compilation five, page twenty seven ninety four.
i could not give it because i filed it before that convenience compilation was there.
i'll just give those, my lord, to the court master so that it can be
linked.
'in the light of the afforded pronunciation of law by this hon'ble court, it is
respectfully submitted that the issue of immunity from criminal prosecution by the legislators under article
one hundred five (two) of the constitution need to be interpreted in the present context.
i'm so sorry.
in the present context where there is extensive criminalization of politics and large number of
persons with criminal antecedents have entered the parliament and the legislative assemblies. now these figures
are very startling, my lord. these are.
from the proceedings in another case this hon'ble court in a pil filed by ashwini
kumar upadhyaya directed setting up special courts in mp's and mla's and passed a series
of directions.
however, the number of pending cases have increased from time to time and the number
of cases, my lord justice, chief justice, my lord justice narasimha, my lord justice mishra
has heard these, my lord, but for your lordships benefit, my lord, for other hon'ble
judges on the bench. in december twenty eighteen, there were four thousand one hundred twenty
two pending cases of which sixteen seventy five were against mp's and twenty three twenty
four against the mla's. out of these cases, cases involving life imprisonment or death penalty
were four hundred thirty.
so, four hundred and thirty cases of death and life imprisonment cases are pending against
legislators, one hundred and eighty against sitting mp's, and two hundred and fifty against the
former mp's or mla's. in december twenty twenty one after, your lordships have passed series
of directions in that case for expedite trial.
the number of pending cases were increased from four thousand nine hundred and eighty four,
out of which eighteen ninety nine were pending for more than five years.
november twenty twenty two, the number of cases further increased to five thousand one hundred
and seventy five out of is twenty one sixty six, forty percent cases are more
than five years old.
now in a report of the association for democratic rights, two hundred and thirty four
out of five hundred and forty two members of lok sabha, seventy one out of.
hansaria, nobody is claiming a one hundred and five privilege in any of those cases.
no, this shows.
your lordship would take into account these figures while interpreting the provisions of the constitution.
that's what i'm trying to emphasize to your lordships. then there are various reports.
can we go straight now to page sixty one, 'parliamentary privilege, not a shield to
commission of crime'.
my lord, para sixty one, page sixty one before that, can i just two or
three odd pages, my lord, just show to your lordships before.
two or three pages, my lord, there are various reports which i have quoted my
lord, including justice. national commission for review of the constitution, justice venkatachaliah. yes, my lord,
justice venkatachaliah's report.
where they cast doubt on pv narasimha rao. directly, hon'ble commission says, my lord, it's
a wrong view and it may be corrected.
and in law commissions two hundred thirty ninth report headed by justice reddy, two hundred
forty fourth report headed by justice and at page fifty four justice venkatachaliah's commission specifically
says, 'it is obvious'.
page fifty four, middle of that page, my lord, that quotation from that report.
'it is obvious that this interpretation of immunity of members of parliament run counters to
all notions of justice, fair play, and good conduct expected from the members of parliament'.
i can say no more, my lord.‘freedom of speech inside the house cannot be used.’
page sixty two.
actually now, page sixty two, you formulate the test.
the expression‘in respect of’ must be interpreted to mean only those acts that are essential
for undertaking the legislature.
so, you’re adopting test of the.
yes, that is the crux of my submission.
before that, can i just show to your lordships, volume four, page fifteen thirteen, what
may has to say, and i'll commend your lordships to accept that interpretation.
volume four, page fifteen thirteen.
it starts.
and paragraph one six dot four comma i’m so sorry.
what is this document?
the documents starts from.
it is may's parliamentary practice. the document starts at page fifteen oh two.
fifteen oh one, the heading, the cover page is there, fifteen oh one.
and, at fifteen thirteen.
my lords have got it?
‘earlier mid-twenty th century, many subsequent cases have their origin in desire.
in the desire to determine the proper limits of the statutory phrase proceedings in the
parliament, some of them with a particular concern of what is integral part of parliament,
or to parliament in the context its claim to exclusive.
in general, the judges have taken the view.’ now, this is what i want your
lordships to kindly consider and accept this proposition.
‘that in a matter in a proceeding of the house, beginning and terminating within its
walls’.
as mister sankaranarayanan says, lord, there was a statement recently, we may not like it,
my lord, but it has been said‘within beginning from, and terminating within the walls of
the house’.
my lord, that is privileged, that nothing can be done.
obviously, outside the jurisdiction of the court.
so, my lord, the expression is‘beginning and terminating within the walls.
within its own walls’, would be privileged, my lord, but nothing outside it.
and same thing is being said at page one fifteen fourteen, at the last two
lines of the first paragraph.
my lord, page fifteen fourteen.
‘he those with rights to be exercised out of, and independently of the house’.
i'll say rights and liabilities.
i'll add that word‘rights and liabilities’ arising out of, and independently of the house, in
which the court must be the arbiter.
yes. even within that my lord. i'm grateful to mister patwalia, the learned amicus.
i can read that fifteen thirteen again, the last lines.
‘in general, the judges have taken the view, that when a matter in a proceeding
of the house, beginning or terminating within its walls, it is obviously outside judicial court,
unless criminal acts are involved’.
so there also, if a criminal act is involved, it is not.
so, an interpretation which protects the criminal act, is definitely outside the privilege, my lord.
and what rights or liabilities arise independently of the house, the court is the arbiter.
that is the test which may has said, and i'll appeal to your lordship to
accept that test my lord, and lay down that as the correct law.
now, my lord, may i just summarize, as my lord, the chief justice has said,
page sixty two, para twenty seven to twenty nine.
that is my final submissions my lord, which i am beseeching your lordships to accept.
it is submitted that the majority judgment granting immunity to all the acts of parliament
that relates to.
that is para one hundred and thirty three, the nexus.
relate to or concern or have a connection or nexus.
these four expressions do not correlate which is sought to be immune, which is too
wide, my lord. 'anything said' or 'vote given in parliament’ is too wide and does
not encompass within the expression 'in respect of' used in clause two of article one
hundred five.
the expression 'in respect of' must be interpreted to mean not only those acts.
or, must be interpreted to mean only those acts which are essential for undertaking the
legislative function.
no privilege can be claimed from criminal persecution.
the penal laws of the country are applicable to the legislators in the same way
as are applicable to ordinary citizens.
the privileges are only those which begin and terminate within the walls of the house,
as may has said.
all actions outside the house are subject to adjudication by the courts. the immunity conferred
by article one hundred and five (two) and one hundred and ninety four (two) is
confined, is only a qualified immunity and not an absolute immunity.
the qualified immunity balances two competing rights, namely 'grant of freedom of speech and expression'
to the vote in the parliament inside the house and hold them accountable for any
crime committed outside the house. my learned friend will deal with it.
it is submitted that commission of any crime can never relate to, in respect of
anything said or vote given by him in parliament and no legislator can claim immunity
from criminal persecution by seeking the protection of parliamentary privilege conferred under article one hundred
five (two) or one hundred ninety four (two).
every person is liable for prosecution for offenses, committed by him or her under the
penal law of the country.
if immunity from prosecutions is granted, the criminalization of politics will get a boost instead
of being curbed.
the immunity would be an easy escape for the lawmakers to avoid penal consequences of
all penal offenses, including any of those offenses, by claiming that such an act was
in respect of anything said or done or vote given by him in parliament. the
immunity if allowed would be limited not only to corruption cases, which i started saying
that, but it can be claimed in respect of serious offenses such as pocso, unlawful
activities act, money laundering acts, hate speech, etcetera.
it would be a license for the legislator to commit a crime without fear of
prosecution and thereafter claim immunity by creating a so called nexus with the speech or
vote given in the house. it is submitted that the criminalization of politics has been
deep rooted in the parliamentary democracy of our country.
the parliament and legislature cannot seek immunity from prosecution in the garb of parliamentary privilege.
the majority in the narasimha rao only encourage the people with criminal antecedent to enter
politics, enter the precincts of parliament and state legislature, and the number of such people
will surge, increase or expand instead of being truncated or brought down.
so my lord. i appeal to your lordships that the minority judgment my lord, may
be.
thank you, mister hansaria. thank you.
may i just say this, my lord. the additional submissions which have been made, my
lord, there are four counsels who wish to address your lordships, which is in volume
eight, my lord. there are four counsels which have said, your lordships may give five
minutes to each of them, the four counsels, who have said, my lord, in that
order only.
miss kalita, doctor sharma, mister bhandari, and miss kariya jabherwala. i'm saying that let it
be in the same order.
that's what.
it will be easier.
yes, mister bhandari, you want to argue?
we will hear mister bhandari for two minutes and then.
please, your lordship. i will take two minutes of your lordship's time.
alright, tell us.
i am grateful to your lordship. your lordship, my submission.
i have given a short submission your lordship, in volume eight page number three and
four, volume eight.
your lordship, my humble submission would be that the parliamentary privilege, your lordship, i would
read.
i would wish to read from my note.
just one second.
your lordship, justice narasimha, has?
yes my humble submission, your lordship, is that the parliamentary privilege and the immunity that
are conferred on the members under article one hundred five (two) and one hundred ninety
four (two) of the constitution of india, for smooth functioning of the parliament, so that
they can vote and speak without any fear, which has been quoted in state of
kerala versus k. ajith your lordship, which is referred in volume five of page number
twenty nine ninety six of para forty four.
your lordship, it is respectfully submitted that such privilege has to be read in consonance
with the basic structure of the constitution of india. and, if the privilege is treated
in an absolute shield, then the very essence of the democracy for the protection of
the rights of the citizens will be lost.
therefore, your lordships, the legislators are the citizens' representatives and they work for the welfare
of the people and therefore they are the lawmakers and cannot be the law breakers.
secondly, your lordship, my humble submission is that the reason for grant of immunity in
respect of anything said or vote given was to ensure that inside the house, the
statement made should not be criminally punishable.
but today, your lordship, this privilege has taken the colour of criminalization and the provision
is being misused under the cover of broad interpretation given by the majority of the
judgment in the case of pv narasimha rao. your lordship, my humble submission is that
the immunity was never intended to place the parliamentarians at the higher pedestal and grant
immunity to them.
no matter how grave or the criminal their acts might be.
you're adopting the minorities stance.
of arising out of.
adopting the minority view.
fair enough.
and your lordship, therefore, if the members of the parliament have done unethical acts and
otherwise contrary to the law, which is out of the periphery of the discharging their
parliamentary duties and responsibilities, then they should not confer the immunity.
thank you.
thank you.
and thirdly, your lordship, 'in respect of' your lordship. the term, the interpretation, your lordship,
'in respect of', should be interpreted to mean arising out of and therefore it should
be purpose of interpretation, limiting the immunity granted under clause two.
now whose.
to only acts and the words.
fair enough.
we will have a look sneha. thank you.
which should also include mere participation your lordship. now, the next submission we have is
of doctor vivek sharma, right?
i'm grateful your lordship. thank you.
thank you.
volume eight, page number six, sir. volume eight, page six, right?
page number six, sir. right, let's see what you say.
to decide basic issue, the immunity from the criminal prosecution involved in this case, three
points should be kept in the consideration.
what was the intention of our constitution makers under article one hundred and five and
one hundred and ninety four?
and the second point is that, whether in democracy, a voter can expect from his
elected representative that he should be allowed to take money or bribe for speech or
vote in the house. the third one is, whether immunity from the criminal prosecution for
taking bribes, money, for vote or speech in the house to mp's, mla's is creating
the different class, who are allowed to corrupt, the basic foundation of the democracy.
in a healthy and honest democracy, elected representative is for the service of nation, there
is no place of immunity, for taking bribes or cash.
and the last one and the d point is that our constitution makers took the
different provision of the constitution from the birth democracies according to indian perspective.
they borrowed parliamentary form of government from the united kingdom, but they did not accepted
the parliamentary supremacy, their ideals and aspirations are very high for the newly born republic
of india. our constitution makers never wanted that by the virtue of privilege under article
one hundred five and one hundred ninety four, the lawmakers would seek criminal immunity from
the bribes, it is not only the immoral but also destroyed the basic structure of
the democracy.
today lawmakers would took bribes or money for vote or speech in the house, tomorrow
the voters would take money for the vote.
then what would happen?
certainly there is no place for immunity from criminal prosecution for taking bribes or money
for vote or speech in house to mp and the mla. so, the minority statement
in the pv narasimha rao case, i think so.
thank you.
thank you doctor sharma. yes, mister bhandari. i'm going to take very briefly, my lords.
i think the debate has surrounded, my lords and we've looked at it from a
perspective, where we are all looking at it as a person, as a parliamentarian who
accepts some money before he walks into the parliament and votes in a particular manner.
but my lords, there will be a large number of permutation and combinations.
there could be a parliamentarian my lords, who takes no money, walks into the parliament,
votes in a particular manner, but comes out, and then after that, takes certain illegal
gratification.
so while, yes, my lords, i support as an intervener that the cloak should be
trimmed.
but, my lords, how far it should be trimmed?
and what should be the boundaries, is something that this court should endeavour to set
it out?
now the minority view in narasimha's case and the majority view, both look at american
jurisprudence, both look at the brewster's judgment which has been read to this court.
the minority, my lords, when they look at brewster's judgment, they come out with a
test that it should be an essential and integral part of the cause of action.
now, my lords to say that it should be an essential and integral part of
the cause of action, would leave my lords, a lot of parliamentarian to prosecution, would
be my humble submission.
and therefore, there needs to be a far more rigid test that needs to be
propounded and needs to be laid down, because my lords, we in a westminster form
of parliament, are not only my lords, parliamentarians who don't necessarily belong to a big
political party.
we have to also ensure that, the cloak is strong enough to protect, let's say
an independent member of parliament. so therefore, when a cloak is being trimmed, there should
be some checks and balances to ensure that false prosecutions and prosecutions which necessarily penetrate
the cloak and starts looking into what the parliamentarian did in the parliament, should not
be allowed.
now my lords, this according to me, this test, which is propounded in the minority
judgment of narasimha, is actually my lords, in tandem with all the judgments in the
us. now my lords, before brewster came, there was a very important judgment called johnson.
and johnson has been critically analysed in the american jurisprudence as saying that it gave
too much of protection to parliamentarians.
however, brewster did not overrule, johnson did not say johnson is wrong law, rather explained
that johnson was right law.
my lords, i just wanted to show you one or two paragraphs of johnson’s to
show that really even if one looks at johnson, which is seen as a very
restrictive case, still the test propounded there would also work in our indian context.
my lords, johnson is item number thirteen, in volume five (a).
item twelve, my lords. it’s page two hundred and two it starts, in volume five
(a).
now interestingly, my lords, johnson’s notes, that the reason this whole immunity came, was not
only to save the parliamentarians from the crown, but also from the judiciary.
and way back, the more fear was the judiciary acting at the behest of the
crown, and that's why this protection came in.
so, the reasons might be quite misplaced in today's times, and therefore, those reasons may
not apply, but my lords, i don't want to take the time of the court,
because i know i'm on very limited time.
i don't want to read why the protection was given, but it's very well explained
at para three and five and six.
but, i want to come to.
straight at the test.
if i can read para five in johnson, because johnson is seen as something which
is far more expansive, and gives more protection to a parliamentarian than what he deserves.
my lords, page two hundred and five, para fifteen.
‘in the same vein, the government contends that the speech or debate clause was not
violated because the gravamen of the count was the alleged conspiracy, not the speech, and
because the defendant, not the prosecution, introduced the speech itself.
whatever room the constitution may allow for such factors in the context of a different
kind of prosecution, we conclude that they cannot serve to save the government's case under
this conspiracy count.
it was undisputed that johnson delivered the speech.
it was likewise undisputed that johnson received the funds.
controversy centred upon the question of who first decided that a speech was desirable, who
prepared it, and what johnson's motives were for making it.
the indictment itself focused with particularly upon the motives underlying the making of the speech
and upon its content’.
i won't read the charge in paraphrase sixteen.
‘we hold, that the prosecution under a general criminal statute dependent on such inquiries, necessarily
contravenes the speech or debate clause. we emphasize that our holding is limited to prosecutions
involving circumstances, such as those presented in the case before us.
our decision does not touch a prosecution which, though as here founded on a criminal
statute of general application, does not draw in question the legislative acts of the defendant
member of the congress, or his motives for performing them.
and without intimating any view thereon, we expressly leave open for consideration when the case
arises, a prosecution, which though possibly entailing inquiry into legislative acts of motivation, is founded
upon a narrowly drawn statute passed by congress in the exercise of his legislative power
to regulate the conduct of its members’.
so, here the court clearly says it does not touch upon a prosecution, though as
here founded on a criminal statute of general application, does not draw in question the
legislative acts of the defendant member of the congress or his motive for performing them.
so, my lords, the issue is not what he did when he entered the parliament.
what speech did he make, who prepared it, and how he prepared it, how he
delivered it, and how much did he emphasize on certain aspects of his speech in
favour of someone?
what matters is what he did before entering into the parliament, or what he did
after he exited the parliament in pursuant of a criminal agreement for illegal gratification.
so, whether the bribe is paid before or after, would have no consequence, because that
act would not be actually looking at the content of the speech.
my lords, the court in brewster, then my lord says, at para thirty nine, at
page two hundred and sixteen.
and this is, i think the aspect that comes out, brewster doesn't say that johnson
is bad law.
it explains johnson by saying that the prosecution should be able to make good the
charge, without asking the prosecution to adduce evidence as to what happened in the parliament.
so, it does not matter my lords, how he voted, because even a bribe taker
may cheat to the bribe giver.
but that is not the gravamen of the offense.
the offense is that, he agreed and accepted to take a bribe.
section seven of the prevention of corruption act of our country does not inquire whether
actually the bribe taker did perform what the bribe giver asked him to do.
the fact that he agreed to do something is good enough for the offense to
happen.
therefore, one does not need to look into what happened inside the parliament and that
is where should be the hard boundary that can the prosecution make a charge and
take it good to the end without looking into what actually happened inside the parliament,
what was the tenor of the speech?
whether he voted in a particular manner or not, or whether he abstained from voting.
if that is the test that whether prosecution can be brought in without scrutinizing the
act inside the parliament, within the confines of the parliament, then my lords according to
me, that the cloak would be good enough to protect what its intention was to
protect the freedom of the parliamentarian.
and para thirty nine in brewster, really catches that.
yes. para. thirty nine and paragraph two in brewster catches that.
so my lords, even judgments in the us, which have taken a slightly different view
from brewster, have been reasoned.
and my lords the last judgment i'm not going to read it my lords, but
where.
which was not cited in narasimha, it was actually there at that time, which considers
both brewster and johnson is in, my lords, volume six, which is very important.
it's mcdade, my lord, us versus mcdade, which is.
the relevant paragraph is at page two hundred and ninety four, where the court says
that, yes, prosecution can't bring in the evidence as to what happened in the parliament.
prosecution has to make its case good on what happened outside the parliament to bring
home a charge.
but the defence can.
so, it will not stop a parliamentarian to show, oh, you are charging me for
corruption, but actually i did not vote in such a manner.
so, he might be able to bring in but the prosecution cannot.
and that is where the test should be.
i'm deeply obliged.
thank you mister bhandari. if i may please, my lords. my submissions start from page
twenty two, volume eight.
yes. my lords, my submissions would be limited to the interpretation of the term 'in
respect of'.
my lords, clause one of article one hundred and five, confers 'freedom of speech' in
parliament, subject not only to other provisions of constitution, but also to rules and standing
orders regulating the procedure of parliament. thus, the freedom of speech is not absolute, but
is subject to various other provisions, as has been mentioned in the article. my lords,
clause two, grants immunity to the members from proceeding in any court in respect of
anything said or vote given by him in parliament. my lords, my humble submission is
the first part of clause two has to be juxtaposed with the second part and
cannot be read in isolation.
they both have to be read together.
further my lords, the term, 'in respect of' cannot be colourably exercised by parliamentarians to
cover within its ambit of being involved in any act or conspiracy or crime outside
the walls of the house. there is no reason to grant complete immunity by interpreting
the word, 'in respect of' to mean anything that relates to, or concern or have
connection with or nexus, as held by majority judgment of hon'ble justice bharucha. my lords,
in point three, i've mentioned that the expression, 'in respect of' is used in constitution
in sixty five other places, apart from article one hundred five (two), and one hundred
ninety four, and in pdf pages twenty four to twenty seven, i have attached the
chart of those articles with the relevant provision.
my lords, if the extraordinarily wide meaning is given to the expression 'in respect of'
as per the majority opinion, the same would also apply to other provisions of the
constitution where these words have been used.
and according to me, this would result in serious and grave consequences and may lead
to incongruous results.
hence, such a wide interpretation should not be given.
for example, my lords, i've taken in point four, under article thirty four of the
constitution, parliament may by law indemnify any person in the service of the union 'in
respect of' any act done by him in connection with restoration of or maintenance of
order in any area where martial law was enforced.
my lord, if an extremely wide interpretation would have the effect of indemnifying or granting
immunity for all acts to that person, when done during the martial law was enforced,
even if the same is not directly related to the restoration or maintenance of order.
similarly my lord, if article one hundred and twenty two, clause two and two hundred
and twelve clause two, would if 'in respect of' would be interpreted in a wider
sense, it would mean the immunity can be claimed even in respect of any action
taken outside the house. which may relate or concern or have nexus with.
so, my lord my humble submission is, that the expression 'in respect of' must be
interpreted to mean something that is intimately connected with the subject, immediately followed by the
said words, 'in respect of'.
it means something directly associated with or banded together or closely linked with the subject
and not any remote nexus.
therefore, my lord, the majority judgment, in my humble submission 'in respect of', should be
limited and should not be given a wide interpretation.
obliged. thank you.
thank you.
now anybody else?
thank you.
all of you have formulated it well.
all the juniors have really formulated it well.
yes, mr attorney. has your task become lighter or heavier, mister attorney?
two written submissions, one earlier.
have they made your task lighter or heavier?
have all the juniors made your task lighter or heavier, mister attorney?
there's a brief note which i had circulated in the morning.
before i take your lordship through that.
court master today's morning note, it is there?
before i take your lordships through that, having been a part of the two hundred
thirty ninth and two hundred forty fourth law commission report, and having partly been author
of the report and concept note written about the importance of looking at criminalisation of
politics, i am personally from saying anything to the contrary.
but apart from that, we are looking at a very, very important consideration of how
do we deal with, an ancient principle of law, that those who are elected representatives,
will enjoy certain protection.
this principle of law has.
we will gather all the constitutions of the world today, they are there in some
form or the other, phraseology notwithstanding.
that means that this principle is very important for, one valid reason that the person
shall be free in the exercise of a function as a member of a legislative
body, without being impeded by any act of impression or impairment.
probably those good old days when executive was a very important aspect to be looked
into.
it may also undergo some forms, metamorphosis today.
the executive need not, cannot be probably directly impair a legislators function, but it can
devise various methods and way of doing this issue as you talk about it.
therefore if, the importance of ensuring that a person elected or a representative shall not
be impaired and shall not be exposed to, undue exertions or coercions, for the same
time that, this office of being elected to a public office, shall not be so
exercised, as to completely dilute the trust and the importance of the office.
then we are looking at how do we balance them.
i don't propose to go into the questioners to the minority versus the majority view,
because if, broadly speaking, all those aspects in a way, a good part of my
thoughts and ideas have been stolen and pirated by all my learned counsel.
so, you can use this very strong expressions.
but i'm trying to summarize why are we so concerned about it, is a concern
expressed by each and every one of them in different ways.
but if you have to grapple with the concern and produce a norm, you're looking
at the court, you're asking the court to produce or generate a norm, which can
probably interpret or apply in the application of article one hundred five and one hundred
ninety two.
it's not really an interpretation, what we're asking the court, is not really an interpretation,
something beyond that.
a mere interpretation giving meanings like, whether the words 'any' or 'in respect of' by
giving such meaning we are trying to clarify, what this important provision the constitution intends
to convey is one aspect of the matter.
well you want to go beyond that and say that the efforts made so far
in various jurisdictions, undertaking the perspectives, whether in us or in australia and canada. i've
also looked at, for instance, countries like philippine, czechoslovakia, and many other european countries.
there's a report in the european parliament on this question.
the transparency international, looking at importance of public life being on ethical and moral consideration.
the same concern runs through universally in all these places.
so, if you are talking about not really interpretation of any word or an expression
in article one hundred and five.
but as i said, interpretations are probably not able to go beyond a stage where
you keep on repeatedly saying,‘well, crime is punishable.
guilty outside, but not guilty inside’.
so, if crime is punishable, then why can't it be said so.
so, if the court had to come and say that one hundred and five does
not contemplate, one hundred and ninety four does not contemplate commission of a crime, whether
it is connected or in respect of or concerning, then, of course, the story is
complete.
so, while the majority try to grapple with this question, i don't think that they
were not alive to the importance of reading one hundred five and one hundred ninety
four very correctly.
they were alive to it, but they took a pragmatic view.
they look at it from the point of.
if you have to say something very radical about crime should be punished, which have
nexus or no nexus, it may be punished, then it probably would require, to some
extent, a rewriting of article one hundred ninety four and one hundred five, in one
sense of the term.
now, if you're looking at actions or proceedings and liabilities which may arise posterior to
a conduct or a speech or vote in a parliament, that's what on a plain
reading of one hundred five and one hundred ninety four it seems to protect, posterior
to a conduct, and what the minority also tries to say that.
so, posterior to your conduct has no difficulty at all.
what speech, what vote was given in the parliament, motives will not be inquired into.
so, what persuasions went to, will not be inquired into.
talking about something anterior to what happens inside, and before the speech or vote is
given, that's what you're talking about.
and then, i am clearly of the opinion that, anything which is offensive under any
law prescribed by a statute, clearly prescribed by statute, cannot have a refuge under the
article one hundred five or one hundred ninety four (two).
i'm very clear about that.
and i don't think any responsible government or any public authority can take a contrary
stand.
let me take your lordships, before i go further, on this two-page note, and then
read my earlier written note.
i don't think i need to trouble your lordships with the reading and re-reading of
all the us judgments.
because what emerged in the course of reading the judgments was, the distinction drawn between
external versus internal activities.
legislative versus political activities.
so, lines are drawn probably to push the protection one way or the other.
so, what is a non-legislative activity for a person who's elected as a representative to
serve the constituency, you have to do a wide range of things.
brewster talks about it in paragraphs somewhere.
so, are they protected?
of course, they will be protected, as long as there is no criminal or unlawful
dimension involved in any one of them.
so, the entire corpus of us law tries to look at that.
but, somewhere i find this clear line to be drawn.
easy line that can be drawn between external versus internal activities, can be somewhat problematic.
i just want to flag that.
because in that context, the whole range of today, whole range of work in the
parliament, depends on an information flow.
so, one of the cases in us was talking about the mail fraud issue, where
for the purpose of getting a particular legislation, you work through a criminal process and
lobbied, the us have a lobbying act.
you can pay for a lobby, register as a lobbyist.
so, we have all that kind of legislative proceedings which have tried to look at
this issue from various angles.
therefore, the information flow is required for a legislator to act may sometimes involve unwittingly
getting into a crime situation, there can be a trap, there can be something which
one does not know.
therefore, these are consideration probably may have to be taken very carefully before the court
lays down a very inflexible norm as to whether anything which happens outside the parliament,
we want the speech and vote activity inside the parliament, anything which happens outside, which
may have a tinge of a.
or a share of a criminal activity will be questionable could be little broadly stated.
i only want to.
a little concern about that.
not that i want to say that, crimes ought not to be.
so, they can't get the protection under article one hundred and five, i'm not saying
that.
and then as i said, the political versus legislative activity is also important aspect.
we try to draw distinction between political, in a sense, broadly political propositions outside, political
campaigns outside.
but they all translate ultimately into a legislative activity.
and that's one of the.
joseph schumpeter noted austrian economists who said, democracy is all about competition, getting into getting
people's minds.
so therefore, this political activity of getting into people's minds and then organizing, arranging a
whole range of political activity, translating them into legislative process.
so, that's where the connection sometimes will have to be kept in mind.
i thought these are important aspects to be reckoned.
and one of the earlier cases i find either in us or somewhere, is it.
the question asked is, is it a protection?
is it a special advantage or a special protection?
the distinction is very important.
you're not asking for a special advantage, but a special protection.
so, the dimensions of a special protection will be therefore seen from all these angles,
from all these dimensions.
let me now take your lordships from a brief note which is in volume nine.
my lords have that?
it's not coming.
it's just a two page note.
it's there in the.
i have a.
court master. yeah.
protection under article one hundred and five (two) and one hundred and ninety four (two)
is confined only to the work because it's in the context of the argument that,
sita soren is to a business or work of functions of the house, it's only
in that regard.
is confined only to the work within or the functions of the parliament or the
legislature as the case may be.
election to rajya sabha is an independent process, regulated by a special set of rules
and is not a business work or function of the parliament. the premises where the
election takes place is not determinative of the matter.
what is not a function or the business of parliament or the legislature, articles one
hundred and five (two) and one hundred and ninety four (two).
the protection extended in articles one hundred and five (two) is a part of the
larger scheme of protection and immunity to parliament and its functions.
the question is not, whether the words, 'in respect of' should be narrowly read or
expansively read.
the view of the majority that the nexus between an antecedent conduct and a speech
made or a vote given in parliament would be the reason for extension of the
protection under article one hundred five (two) stems from the view that the antecedent conduct,
right or wrong, shall not affect or weaken the importance of the protection to speech
or vote inside the legislatures.
the nexus test, thus may have the effect of exclusion, criminal liability, civil or criminal,
regardless of the unlawfulness or otherwise of the context, which leads to or is connected
to the speech made or vote given.
this test requires disregarding the nature of the antecedent conduct.
all that one hundred and ninety seven crpc sanction etcetera.
the nexus test will not be a safe guide.
at the same time, the possibility of any hostile or adverse action being taken on
an estimation of perception of a speech or vote should also be kept in mind.
the view of the minority that an act that precedes the making of a speech
or giving of a vote may not at all qualify a protection regardless of it's
connection to speech made or vote given, also deserves to be moderated.
on a plain reading of articles one hundred and five (two) and one hundred and
ninety four (two), and keeping in mind the need for freedom of conduct of elected
representative, without being exposed to undue and unreasonable action and proceeding.
it can be said that, conduct which is otherwise clearly unlawful, and unlawful by reason
we're being prescribed by a statue, will not ordinarily receive the protection against liabilities.
however, as a matter of prudence and without sacrificing the importance of high ethical and
moral standards in the political field, it will be worthwhile to propose an in-house committee
of the respective legislatures, to be the speech and vote watch, whose, recommendation can be
the basis for all liabilities.
the tenth schedule to the constitution of india is a parallel.
see narasimha rao is only in the context to a vote given in parliament. the
review by the court, be advisedly confined, only to limited aspect, and not to any
of the larger questions of powers, privileges, and immunities, and perhaps not even to the
question of the ambit of speech made in the legislature.
right, i say this so because the speech check can have a variety of dimensions,
whether you take away the antecedent part of it or not.
then one has to explain the extent of the speech which requires protection.
therefore, i thought the speech part of it in the context of the facts of
this case, the speech part of it does not arise at all, even though counsel
have advised the court on the entirety of the spectrum of vote and speech.
so that’s.
i thought will be the narrow ground on which i. under.
the court, your lordship may therefore take to the earlier written note where i have
a few other aspects.
volume two, right?
that is in volume two.
because if one hundred and five and one hundred and ninety four are as integral
part of the constitution as, article fourteen.
.
before i forget.
yes. well i'm not sure whether if i read it, i just want to in
conclusion with the line of thought which i shared with your lordships. i'm not sure
whether we need to go that far, as to look in the basic structure doctrine
on.
test this on article fourteen, etcetera.
because i think once the freedom of speech and the article one hundred and five
(one) and one hundred and five (three), they are the broader aspects of parliamentary independence
and functioning.
in that context one hundred and five is nestled to say to a different extent.
and if that's part of the constitution, i say it's also part of the basic
structure of the constitution. the freedom over the function of the parliament members elected there,
to say that their freedom will be impaired by anything which not dealt with, by
law, but by any other understanding of the law.
i mean, it's going to be little problematic.
therefore, let us not go to an article fourteen dimension or basic structure doctrine, to
look at the relevance or importance of the reading or construction of article one hundred
five.
now, if we complete the reading of this written submission.
this is, the first part of it is of course confined to the facts of
this case, because an argument is that narasimha rao would apply, narasimha rao need not
be revisited, to just respond to that.
i think in my understanding and the facts of this case where the election to
the council of states happens outside and not a function or a business or a
work or the parliament or the legislature, then narasimha rao would not apply.
narasimha rao is a case where a no confidence motion, there is a lot of
literature in what exactly the functions of a legislature. today it's a wide range of
functions, there are even an advisory function.
the number of committees that have been constituted by the parliament across the world, they're
truly very exemplary.
i mean, you look at the range of functions, parliament cannot deal with them all
over.
the committees are the alter egos of the parliament in one sense of the term.
therefore the question as to what happens as a conductor, the worker, is also important.
so on the facts of this case, i think that narasimha rao would not apply.
and if it does not apply, the asking of the appellant, perhaps narasimha rao to
be revisited or not, does not arise.
let me quickly read this part of the written submissions.
‘the appellant has sought the protection of article one hundred and ninety four to the
constitution as a ground for discharge in the criminal prosecution launched against us.
neither before the hon'ble high court, nor before this hon'ble court, any other contention has
been raised as relevant for the purpose of this charge.
full reliance is placed on the pv narasimha rao dictum.
therefore, the short question for the purpose of disposal of the appeal would be, as
to whether narasimha rao would apply at all.
the question as to whether the appellant has committed any offense at all, solely with
reference to the fact, is not a matter for consideration in these proceedings.
the question would be, whether the conduct attributed to her does not have that colour
of an offense by reason of the protective clause of article one hundred ninety four
(two).
for that purpose, the only matter to be considered will be, whether the exercise of
the franchise of an elected member of the state legislature, for the purpose of election
to the council of states, will be speech and vote, within the meaning of article
one hundred ninety four (two).
the submission that the invocation of article one hundred and ninety four (two) by the
appellant, is not a compulsion to wriggle out of an act of bribery, can any
submission in relation to invocation of article one hundred ninety four (two) the distinctions sought
to be made in paragraphs one, two, three of the written submission of mister raja
ramachandran, under the heading,‘the case at hand’, is no distinction at all.
the speech and vote immunity is an ancient immunity, and is being considered to be
a shield against executive operation of persecution.
long history of decided cases show the relevance of protecting the speech and vote conduct
to the elected representatives, from being exposed to civil or criminal action.
either speech and conduct in relation to the manifold functions of the legislature, where the
elected representatives participate, that stands protected.
in all cases where the elected representative seeks to protect his shelter of article one
hundred and ninety four (two), the inquiry will be, as to whether the speech and
vote is in relation to the manifold functions of legislature discharge as a legislative assembly.
any conduct, other than conduct related to legislative function, will thus fall outside article one
hundred ninety four (two).
for the purpose of disposal of case with the appellant, the inquiry as to what
is speech and vote in relation to the manifold functions of the legislature, need not
be taken recourse for the reason, that the process of election to the council of
state is like any other election process, and cannot be treated as a matter of
business that are functions of the work of the legislature. casting a vote for the
purpose of election of members to the council of state, is not to be equated
with the words‘vote given’ in the legislature in any committee thereof.
it submitted that reliance placed in pashupati nath sukul, mukul, so and so, kuldip nayar,
is in order.
the question is not whether parliamentary immunity has been sought and invoked in the said
cases.
the statement of law, that matters of election, either to the council of state or
exercised to the president vice president or not, speech and vote, within the scope of
article one hundred five (two) and one hundred ninety four (two), will hold good, regardless
of the context in which the statements have been made.
the submission to the contrary, in paragraph f of the appellant’s written submission, is not
persuasive.
legislature is a term which is synonymous with legislative assembly, which is a body of
persons invested with the power of enacting laws.
in the context of parliament, legislature means either house of parliament. in the context of
state legislature, it will comprehend the legislative assembly or the legislative council, as the case
may be.
the speech and vote expression therefore relate the discharge of functions of both the houses.
the distinction, if any, between legislature and house of legislature, has no bearing on the
issue of understanding the speech and vote expression.
whether the governor would be included to the term legislature, is no matter relevance for
the purpose of of the speech and vote expression’.
see in this regard so and so.
‘the question again is not one of proceedings on the floor of premises of the
house. the question would already be whether the conduct in person, is in the context
of the business or function of the legislature. all proceedings of all parliamentary committees are
accorded the same status of the proceedings in parliament or state legislature, as the case
may be.
the question is not the place or venue of the proceedings of the committees, what
qualifies as a respective task assigned to the committee and what transpires in the course
of deliberation with the committees.
it is submitted, the conduct of the appellant in relation to the election to the
council of states, not being a conduct relating to the function of legislature, will not
qualify for the protection under article one hundred ninety four (two).
then the next part of it, generally will address the submissions i made, but quickly
i run through them.
the subject of privileges and immunities of elected representatives is universally found in constitutional documents.
similarly, despite difference in phraseology, protection is extended to speeches that we made or votes
that we tendered by elected representatives in relation to the conduct or business of work
in the legislative body.
it would be a tedious and contentious exposure if elected representatives have to defend themselves
in respect of their conduct and in relation to their work or business of the
legislative body.
the logic and relevance of the protection is well settled.
the question of connection and nexus between conduct antecedent to the speech and vote exercised
in a legislative body, particularly when the antecedent conduct may be designated as unlawful or
prosecuted by law, has been a vexed question.
instance of corrupt or undesirable motives whether in presentation of private member bills or working
in mainstream legislation have received the attention of hon'ble courts. see, in this regard the
three articles which give a complete understanding what the us and is also in european
context.
i'll just read a few pages of them, but i don't want to trouble your
lordships with the entirety of these three articles.
then paragraph twelve.
extreme case of submission of bills of expenditure by elected representatives beyond legally sanctioned limits,
have been found to be on the protection of immunity and privileges, chaytor. such instances,
do not present a difficulty in understanding the scope of immunity.
conduct falling in such class being otherwise unlawful and with no connection or relationship with
the business, function or work of the legislative body will fall outside the immunity's umbrella.
the view taken by the majority in narasimha rao is a guarded view.
it is not that this hon'ble court lost sight of the shades of opinion.
the supreme court of the united states in johnson and brewster. the opinions of the
minority judges, we consider as coming close to the desirability of looking at high standards
of conduct where elected members of legislatures and the needs of parliamentary intervention in that
regard.
your brief glance, at deliberations and debates across different jurisdictions and the scope of parliamentary
immunity and the incompatibilities of the conduct which is offensive, undesirable, unlawful, etcetera.
demonstrate the need for raising the ethical and moral level of conduct of elected representative.
now, then paragraph thirteen, fifteen.
the question asked whether narasimha rao deserves reconsideration may not hinge only on the majority
or the minority understanding of the law.
while it is highly desirable that the elected members and legislators conduct themselves at the
highest level of ethical and moral, in order that the values of trust and democracy
are not impaired.
the question as to laying down norms, as guiding criteria would still be and desirably
so, a matter of parliamentary deliberation.
while the desirability of delineating and setting down the principle, which may govern the scope
and applications of the speech and vote clause, is not to be a doubted.
the matter of laying down enforceable norms may warrant a wide debate and legislative intervention,
including intervention by state legislators and with regard to the multitude of functions of legislative
bodies both directly and through their committee proceedings in keshav singh, all state legislatures and
then all high courts, in fact, probably i could have suggested the hon'ble court to
take recourse to that.
but now that the court has convened and we have presented our arguments, i only
say that in the context of these important deliberations the norm laying down, you know,
importance.
anything else mister attorney?
interestingly, the attorney general has suggested, a more functional test.
he has steered clear of either the nexus test or the essential legislative functions test.
and it's more of a functional test.
so broadly, what that would mean, the third test, it should be a functional test.
immunity would extend to speech or acts of voting necessary for the discharge of the
duties of a member of the legislature without fear of consequences.
so, it's more functional that you are really having regards to the object and purpose
of the grant of that immunity.
yeah. that's why i thought that the court is not required to go into the
second part of article one hundred and five (two).
actually, article one hundred and five (two), the first part refers to in parliament. it
uses the word in parliament, so in parliament would therefore possibly refer to the physical
space of parliament. the latter part is not qualified by in parliament, so you publish
something under the authority of parliament. you'll publish it outside, parliament may authorize somebody to
publish something outside, but it's protected.
no. even there in that context whether.
because you are publishing a record of what happened in parliament. that's why the second
part says, the second part is one hundred five (two), says.
in respect of any report, paper, votes or proceedings.
so report, paper, votes or proceedings is obviously something which took place in parliament. so
though you are publishing it outside, if it's done with by or under the authority
of parliament, it's beyond any question.
yes, it's protected, but the first part says in parliament. therefore, it's proceedings.
so in respect of the parliament or a committee thereof.
in fact, article one hundred and five (one) also says in parliament, it says in
parliament, there shall be freedom of speech in parliament. freedom of speech, in parliament. that's
a general, the wholesale proposition.
parliamentary independence, doing what it intends to do, and nobody will say from outside, look
here how did you speak in parliament like this?
so if a parliamentarian makes a speech outside parliament, that's not protected.
there's no immunity, which attaches to that.
no, even.
the us constitutional law is littered with all those examples of the speeches made outside
parliament, outside the congress, but in connection.
that's why the question is whether it is a political activity or a legislative activity?
that kind of a dialogue.
in part as such.
no, we are not concerned.
because that says no person, so obviously person is used in contradistinction to a member
of parliament. it will include, of course, a member of parliament also.
no person shall be so liable, so liable means to a court in any proceeding,
in respect of the publication, by or under the authority of either house of parliament.
so, if the publications done by or under the authority of either house of parliament.
that's completely protected.
and a publication of what?
a publication of a report, paper, votes or proceedings.
like the search light.
thank you.
thank you for your intervention and for assisting us.
your lordship, please?
thank you.
anything else, mister attorney?
i just want to draw your attention to few a articles, where i thought some
reflections seem to be important.
we'll have a look at those article.
two articles which you have referred.
i'll just give those references.
just give us the.
in volume four (a), i also don't propose to go into the question, whether on
a proper reading or a correct reading or the prevention of corruption act. this question
need not be even gone into, because once they fall under prevention of corruption act,
nothing else needs to be inquired into.
volume four a, page?
page five hundred and fifty.
and. it's an article of the transparency international and i'll just give the few page
references at page five hundred and fifty one.
yes. where they deal with the whole question of narrow versus wide immunity and they
also give some illustrations in different countries.
five hundred and fifty one, five hundred and fifty two, five hundred and fifty three,
thereafter at five hundred and fifty six.
alright, any other article?
would you like us to look at any other article?
just a minute.
yes, sure.
in the same volume.
yes distinction between britain, canada, and france. france has a slightly different position, not only
on accountability, but also in violability.
that's a certain important shade of difference.
that your lordships will find in page forty four.
same volume?
in the same volume.
they're all in the same volume.
page forty four.
then next is an article at page sixty six, in the same volume.
sixty six? sixty six.
then page three hundred and twenty nine.
this takes stock of the law in the european parliament situation.
and at page one hundred and sixty one, again, it's a publication by the directorate
general of european parliament. so, they virtually look at the european position in various countries.
and one is, not surprised to note.
is that, the crime part of the elected members.
it’s is not something very peculiar to any particular part of the globe.
so, these i thought would probably throw some light on the generality of these issues,
and as i submitted to your lordships, the question of laying down a norm in
reading one hundred ninety four and one hundred five.
it has to be.
thank you, mister attorney. the sg is going to argue now, mister i'm not going
to take more than twenty minutes.
all right.
we'll come back at two o'clock.
my lord, can your lordship permit me to address virtually, my lord?
absolutely, yes, yes.
there's no difficulty.
we are on the hybrid mode.
please feel free.
no difficulty at all.
so, we'll resume at two o'clock.
and after the learned sg completes, then mister ramachandran, a brief rejoinder from you?
i am not going to repeat anything.
only one new dimension, which may assist your lordship. i have one suggestion to the
learned ag, that these articles which are mentioned in volume four (a), they don't have
the citation.
so, if you have to cite it, it may be a little difficult.
yes. mister attorney, if you can just ask your junior after lunch, to just give
us the citation.
those four articles or five articles, just the citation.
we'll do that.
.
on a separate page of piece of paper.
yes, thank you, mister attorney general. mister ramachandran?
we will hear mister ramachandran now in rejoinder.
oh, solicitor, oh so sorry.
mister solicitor has to argue.
mister solicitor?
yes my lords. i'm extremely sorry once again.
i am unable to join physically which i should have my lord but i'm still
under the bout of some viral.
that's the reason, otherwise i would have been physically before your lordships, but my coming
there would be harmful to others.
yes please come to page three.
i'm not repeating anything.
yeah, page three of your written submission?
my written submissions.
your lordships would find at volume six.
i am sorry, volume two (b).
this can be perhaps, one more angle from which your lordships can consider the question
whether bribery can at all be protected by the immunity or the privilege.
yes, you are referring to page three, para five, mister solicitor?
yes, because neither the majority nor the minority in narasimha rao examines the issue from
this point of view.
right, let’s see para five onwards.
let's see how you have formulated it.
i have formulated para five.
it is submitted that the real issue is not the contours of legislative privilege in
relation to the parliament or the state legislatures. rather the short question on which the
present reference can be decided easily, whether the offense of bribery is complete outside the
legislature house, legislative house. if it is complete outside the house then your lordships need
not be bothered by us as to whether they would be protected, immunity would stand
extended, privilege will be granted et cetera.
please see.
but actually the place, mister solicitor, the place where it is completed or whether it
is antecedent or subsequent to the speech or vote, really should not matter in that
sense, because then it will be a fortuitous circumstance.
so, suppose, we'll just give you a hypothetical example.
suppose the agreement to pay a bribe is arrived at within the house itself, may
not be within the, beyond the realm of possibility, that then agreement to pay the
bribe is the offer and the acceptance takes place within the house. maybe when somebody
is, some third party is visiting the house for a committee meeting.
we're just giving you a hypothetical possibility.
just the argument.
it makes no difference.
so, it would not really in that sense, it should make no difference to the
final argument or the legal position, in that sense.
there is a reason why i would.
of course, bribery, you are right.
this has come on a very very strong footing that well, the offense of bribery
is complete outside the house, you said.
yes, my lord. there is a reason why i'm reading the provisions of section seven,
where it existed, when narasimha rao judgment was decided.
the reason is in ' eighteen.
twenty eighteen, section seven came to be amended.
the argument in narasimha rao is that the performance of the promise for which you
took the money would be a relevant guiding principle.
right. whether you voted, you voted in favour, whether you voted against it, et cetera.
if that is the logic, which according to me is a flawed logic, then that
gets further my lord substantiated.
my submission is substantiated by the amended provision.
but before that i may show the.
fair enough.
i now got it.
let's see para five onwards.
we can first read your formulation and then you can maybe explain it to us.
para six.
the privilege in terms of article one hundred and five (two) and one hundred and
ninety four (two) of the constitution attaches to anything said or any vote given, by
a member in parliament or the state legislature, as the case may be.
if on the reading of section seven, the offense thereunder can be said to be
complete, independent of and without a reference to anything said, or any vote given, in
parliament or the state legislature, no question of any legislative privilege being effected can arise
if the member is prosecuted for taking a bribe for the speech or the vote.
now please see, my lord, section seven, which existed at the time of the judgement.
public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.
whoever being or expecting to be a public servant, i'm just giving a hypothetical example,
i am contesting the election and i'm promising that if i become an mp, i'll
do something for you expecting to be a public servant, then accepts or obtains or
agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, now from whom?
any person.
for whom?
for himself or for any other person.
what?
any gratification whatsoever, whatever other than legal remuneration.
for what?
as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do, either to vote or
abstain from voting, either to vote in favour, vote against, or abstain from voting.
any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his
official functions, favour or disfavour to any person for rendering or attempting to render any
service or disservice to any person with the central government. please note this, or any
state government or parliament or the legislature of the state.
my lord, the legislature, while formulating section seven was conscious or at least presumed to
be conscious of the provisions contained in section one hundred five and one hundred ninety
four.
yes. and therefore specifically makes reference to parliament or legislative assembly while defining and providing
for the punishment for bribery.
my lord, perhaps maybe this is a little, it can be said to be a
little far-fetched but is it not.
i am posing a question to myself, a manifestation of article one hundred and ninety
four (three).
one hundred and ninety four (three) says that the parliament can legislate as to what
would be excluded from the immunities of privileges.
so by incorporating parliament and legislature in the definition of the prevention of corruption act
itself.
yes. the second ingredients my lords, which is quite startling, your lordships are aware, that
places the majority in pv narasimha rao case holds that if everything would depend what
you do, after you go inside the all of hall of parliament or within the
parliament, whether you vote, you do not vote, you vote as per the promise given,
et cetera.
here performance of that motive or reward for which my lord, you were paid bribe
is not an ingredient at all.
the moment i accept or agrees to accept or attempts to accept or obtain, the
crime is complete.
yes. so performance, which is an underlying ratio in the senior, in majority view pv
narasimha rao case is absent.
yes. similarly at page four, i have placed for your lordships consideration section thirteen, as
it existed there.
again performance what you do, is irrelevant.
your lordships are right, my lord, in many cases, it is quite possible that the
agreement takes place within the house. in extraordinary cases, even the acceptance of money also
can take place inside the house. but your lordship would not interpret the provision based
upon.
the place at which the bribe is given.
yes. and some extraordinary circumstances.
suppose one mp hands over a bag containing two crores to another mp inside the
house that you vote in a particular way.
quite possible, but it is one out of thousand possibility.
generally, we go by the prevention of corruption act the way in which bribery takes
place.
so your lordships' interpretation may perhaps not be guided by extreme examples.
yes. now, if your lordship, can ignore, there are some judgments which analyses these provisions.
but please directly come to the amended part.
thereafter i have quoted the minority view of my lord justice s c agarwal. your
lordships have been taken through this.
i don't think i would be justified in reiterating, or re- reading the whole thing.
your lordships may kindly directly come to para sixty.
now, this is amended section seven.
i'm sorry.
page sixty.
this is amended section seven where the performance which is the underlying ratio in the
majority judgment is specifically excluded.
does your lordships, my lords have section seven?
yes. this is section seven of twenty eighteen amendment.
please read my lord. any public servant who obtains or accepts or attempts to obtain
from any person an undue advantage with the intention to perform or cause performance of
public duty improperly, his intention not that he will perform but it becomes further clear.
when i pay the bribe, my intention is that somebody would either perform something or
will not perform something, improperly or dishonestly or to forbear or cause forbearance to perform
such duty, either by himself or by another public servant or, it is disjunctive, or
obtains or accept or attempts to obtain an undue advantage from any person as a
reward for the improper or dishonest performance of a public duty or for forbearing to
perform such duty, either by himself or another public servant.
so my expectation is that you will perform or not perform.
but for the purpose of completing the offense, that performance is not necessary.
that is becoming clear in explanation one.
before that i must read c. after two disjunctive expressions or please see c, performs
or induces another public servant to perform improperly or dishonestly a public duty, or to
forbear performance of such duty in anticipation of or in consequence of accepting an undue
advantage from any person.
these are three separate categories of offenses.
yes. now, it is made exceptionally clear in the explanation one, immediately my lord, following
subsection c. explanation one; for the purpose of this section obtaining, the obtaining, accepting or
the attempting to obtain an undue advantage shall itself constitute an offence even if the
performance of a public duty by a public servant is not, or has not been
improper.
suppose he goes inside and discharges his duties properly, but he accepts the money.
my respectful submission is that the connection essentially established in majority view of narasimha rao
as to have you perform your part of the bargain, is irrelevant for the offense
of bribery.
the majority does not typically dwell on this at all.
actually, it is the minority.
justice agarwal says that well the offense of bribery is complete, the moment that there
is an agreement.
that's my lord, the correct view.
this is completely, what happens is, the majority says.
the majority did not deal with it at all.
nor did the majority say that unless there is performance, there is no bribery.
they don't say to the contrary also.
yes, my lord. but, when they say that unless there is performance, there is no
bribery.
that's how they.
alright.
may perhaps run contrary to the.
thats the.
alright. my lord, para fifty on the page seventy.
my lord, that's exactly what your lordships hinted.
interestingly, on the aspect of the offense of bribery being complete outside the legislative house
or parliament itself even the majority view holds the same.
majority view to the extent it holds that prosecution against so and so would continue
thus on the sole understanding that the offense of bribery was complete outside the house
itself and does not require a vote in the house. then my lord, i may
not read.
your lordships, have read and reread the provisions.
i am just taking your lordships through what we could find out to assist your
lordships. i'm not reading it because now, the way in which even the petitioners have
argued, this may not have any direct relationship because it's nobody's case that there need
not be a privilege or immunity.
everyone says that there has to be.
the only question is, whether bribery can ever be protected under the privilege or immunity.
the nature of parliamentary privilege, your lordships are aware, i am not reading it.
i have quoted several authors et cetera.
then page twenty one, 'need for the privilege'.
your lordships are aware, to ensure that i vote, i exercise my rights and perform
my duties freely and fearlessly.
that's my lord, in one line, 'the object of the privilege'.
then your lordships, may directly come to the position in india, at page twenty four,
at the foot.
i am not reading it, my lord. we have catered various provisions and for example,
page twenty six, government of india act nineteen thirty five had similar provisions for immunity
and privileges.
that was section twenty eight of the government of india act. substantially, that is adopted
in the constitution but i am not reading it.
then your lordships may kindly come to page twenty nine.
case law on privilege.
my lord, whatever judgments are delivered so far to our knowledge, there may have been
few which we have missed, are quoted, relevant provision is quoted.
if your lordships would like to go through them.
then page thirty three, is position across the world.
we have tried and culled out the position across the world.
again my lord, for this limited question which your lordships are examining, this may perhaps
not be the relevant, except for some academic interest.
then my lord thirty seven is chaytor. this is the judgement, my lord that i
respectfully rely upon.
but i'm told this is also read before your lordships. do i read it, or
i may not trouble your lordship?
but i think i should not trouble your lordships. which one were you saying?
page thirty seven. thirty seven.
r versus chaytor. chaytor.i think we have looked at.
yes.
my lordships have seen that.
so i have just put in the relevant paragraph for ready reference.
but i don't think i. but at the foot of page thirty nine there is
one para two hundred and forty six.
this is the concurring view in chaytor. yes. seventy three not two hundred and forty
six. seventy three.
a little later, the report considers the dividing line between matters that fall within the
type of parliamentary privilege and those which fall outside.
this lies at the heart of these appeals and quotation in full.
this quotation is the concurring view in chaytor. it takes the same view in a
different phraseology and different way.
that also my lordships are taken through.
there is no much development in america after the narasimha rao judgment.
that's what we found, subject to the other side pointing out anything new.
there is virtually none.
then page forty two, voting or speech in parliament is the core parliament activity.
your lordships are aware but may not be a matter of contention.
nobody would dispute this proposition, but the judgments including raja ram pal, i have quoted,
but as your lordships have very rightly and kindly pointed out that your lordships are
not going to revisit that, therefore i'm not troubling your lordships. then page forty five.
this, my lord, as a proposition of law, could be very, very relevant, because self
regulation is essential ingredient of separation of powers.
all the three.
basically my lordships are aware, parliamentary privilege is essentially against the crown, against the executive
but the law which has developed or evolved is, that all three organs of the
state would have the right and power of exclusive self-regulation without any interference by the
other.
in other words, my lord, the independence of self-regulatory power of parliament is as sacrosanct
as my lord, independence of judiciary or independence of executive. that's the judgment on this.
then my lord, page forty six.
examples of exercise of power by parliament itself.
this may be of some interest to your lordships. of course, this may not assist
your lordships in arriving at any conclusion on the question on it but whatever examples
we could find out in india, that how this power of self-regulation is utilized by
our parliament, those examples are cited.
right from my lord, mudgal case, then cash for votes case where some mp's came
and throw some bundles of money, et cetera, et cetera.
but i'm not taking your lordship because this is more for some other academic interest
rather than assisting your lordships. my lord again, i'm emphasizing privilege as a concomitant of
separation of powers, but your lordships are not examining the concept of privilege as such,
and therefore i am not reading any of these judgments.
then, development of the law on privileges, again from the narrow compass of bribery vis-a-vis
privilege do not have much assistance.
but since your lordship said that whatever research we have done, please place it, so
that your lordships gets everything on one page.
so that's what we have done.
yes. this is my respectful submission that bribery can never be a subject matter of
immunity.
unless of course, one out of thousand cases takes place within the house. this exam,
this is not examined.
this angle is not examined either by majority or minority.
so this is not just for your lordship's kind consideration.
instead of declaring narasimha rao to be not a good law, my lordships may have
an option of saying that it is per in curium because it does not take
into account the statutory scheme of the prevention of corruption.
yes. performance is irrelevant and the offense which encompass all its ingredients does not include
performance, and when everything is outside the house is the offense is complete outside the
house, there is no question of privilege being claimed or immunity being established.
yes. these are my respectful submissions.
thank you mister solicitor. thankyou. apologies my lord. thankful my lords permitted me for virtual.
thank you mister solicitor. yes mister ramachandran. yes. grateful your lordship. firstly, an observation from
the bench about not speaking, not voting.
i, respectfully bow down to that observation and respectfully agree that the immunity must extend
not just to speaking and voting but also remaining silent and abstention and in this
context, kindly bear in mind that when you are voting on the floor of the
house in a modern house, there is an aye button, there is a no button,
and there is an abstention button.
so an abstention is also a vote given.
and the significance of an abstention also whether it is in the matter of a
vote of no confidence on which the survival or otherwise of a government depends or
in the only known case in our constitutional history, my lords, of impeachment of a
judge of this court, it's the abstention, which made the difference.
and there of course, it was a whip of the ruling party, so the ruling
party en bloc abstained.
but in a given case, an individual abstention or two or three abstentions could make
the difference.
and so if such abstention is also made culpable, it would definitely be in respect
of a vote given and therefore, my respectful concurrence of the observation which came from
the bench.
yes. now as far as the learned attorney general's submission is concerned, he says my
lords, that the judgment in narasimha rao's case, the majority, takes a guarded view.
i haven't understood the attorney's submission as saying that the majority is wrong.
i understood him and that is why my lord, i took the precaution in my
main argument of addressing his argument on why narasimha rao is not attracted.
the attorney general's argument is only this that voting is not legislative and i would
reiterate it as legislative for an additional reason, which i am going to give, but
otherwise the attorney general seems to be ad idem with our submission that the guarded
view narasimha rao deserves to be preserved.
the solicitor general's argument is concentrated on the offense of bribery being complete and that
is the argument my lords, of the learned amicus and they are interveners led by
mister sankaranarayanan. now, that argument begs the question of what does 'in respect of' mean?
yes, there can be no doubt that the offense of bribery has been committed at
an anterior point of time.
but if it is in contemplation of the vote, notwithstanding the criminality, the link with
the future vote brings it within the umbrella of privilege, notwithstanding the anterior criminality.
yes. today, two of the learned counsel for the interveners, mister sankaranarayanan and mister hansaria,
made a reference to hate speech, in the context of the recent hate speech.
now, i am fortified in my argument by that example for the reason my lords.
let us take that hate speech example.
mister ramachandran, if the ingredients of the offense.
your lordship, please.
the situs of the ingredients of the offense is in the speech itself, then there
is a.
then it is immune.
then the immunity is attracted.
we are not on the morality of it or whether it is proper or improper.
but if the offense lies in the speech itself.
if it was only in the speech, yes.
but now, suppose right now you are, you are on your.
you say something about your opponent or you say something about a community, all right.
that speech itself is the offense, that is immune.
the speaker of that speech is therefore clearly immune, because that is the matter of
privilege.
absolutely. but i'm going.
i am not on the.
you are now saying that, irrespective of the.
if the antecedent criminality, if the vote is a consequence of the antecedent criminality, then
that itself is also within the ambit of the privileges and your lordship please, and
for that, i didn't complete that hate speech example.
of course my lords, if the situs is the hate speech itself, but there can
be an anterior event even in respect of a hate speech.
a hate speech need not be necessarily a spontaneous speech on the floor of the
house. there can be an example of a pre-planned.
of course.
there may be a bribe given in, there may be a bribe given in consideration
of a hate speech which is made on the floor of the house. there can
be a pre-planned conspiracy.
there can be a pre planned conspiracy.
but then the prosecution is not for the hate speech but for the bribery, which
was underlying feature of the hate speech.
i am on the offense of conspiracy, which is an offense by itself.
it's a conspiracy to commit a crime.
now, therefore if mp x, five days prior to the sitting of parliament, has a
meeting in his constituency with three or four of his constituents, that let us put
these people in their place.
i'm going to say this, this, this and i'll say it in parliament. let's see
what happens.
nobody can do anything.
and in pursuance of such a conspiracy between an mp and his constituents, it is
decided to therefore make that speech on that occasion because of the immunity.
the offense of conspiracy is complete five days earlier because they have conspired to commit
a crime.
therefore how far do we then go in attaching criminality and the submission which i
made, which i reiterate now, in this context, is that you can't bifurcate criminal offenses
and say, we are talking only of bribery.
don't touch anything else.
bribery. no, it is not just bribery which has an antecedent element because the physical
act has taken place before.
any other criminal act can have an antecedentary element.
that's the proviso to one hundred and twenty eight.
yes my lordship. lordships please, or as justice narasimha just observed, defamation.
so someone's character is to be besmudged.
so you agree among yourselves, that i'll say it in parliament. what is one hundred
and twenty (a) my lords?
see the definition of criminal conspiracy.
when two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done, one, an
illegal act, so let us take one hundred fifty three (a), enmity between different groups.
ramachandran, you are trying to read something into this provision, which we don't find it
there and then.
scope is totally different.
that is what we are trying to tell you.
with respect.
no my lords. one hundred and five.
it deals with a right of a member to have his freedom of expression, speech,
and to vote.
that right is recognized, number one.
recognition of the right, if he exercises his right, by way of speech, by a
voting, the consequence also protected.
while doing that the parliament has got its own privilege, how they deal with it,
like we can expunge it or we can.
expel the member.
we can expel him or if the vote is invalid, it can do that.
now where is a question of criminality coming here?
protection is very limited.
what is happening within the house, we are trying to make it much more wider,
which is not even under the provision.
now the privilege which is given is maintaining the sanctity of the house. alright, anything
is happening here, please don't take it out to street.
nobody should be able to deal with it.
what is happening otherwise, what they do see, we are not able to decipher anything
under the provision.
whichever way you like to read it, whatever interpretation you give, let us give a
simple interpretation.
what are the objective behind this?
beyond that.
therefore my lords, my submission is that we are going away from that simple interpretation,
if we try to say that bribery is anterior, offense is committed, and for that
i am drawing an analogy with this, that if you conspire to defame, if you
conspire to commit hate speech which is anterior and then go and commit it in
the house, then by that logic.
the defamation which is to take place is on the floor of the house, then
the act of defamation itself, is immune from any prosecution.
in such a situation can the conspiracy itself become actionable under one hundred and twenty
(a)?
because one hundred and twenty (a).
let us see.
let us see the definition.
let us see the definition.
when two or more persons.
agree. it just says agreement.
one hundred and twenty (a) is agreement.
agree to do what?
an illegal act?
now if the agreement is to make a speech in parliament or the state legislature,
which is going to be allegedly defamatory, that act itself is not illegal because that
act is completely within the scope of the immunity, the speech itself is protected.
i'm sorry, can i just read out the ingredients of the section and my lords,
respond to my lord the chief justice?
when two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done, an illegal
act.
the essence or the element, the critical element is the agreement.
once there's an agreement that itself, the offense is complete.
but the agreement constitutes an offense, if what is intended to be done is an
illegal act or an act which is not illegal by illegal means.
my lordship.
so, if the act which you are going to, two people sit in the house
of a member of parliament, or five people sit in the house of a member
of parliament and say on this day in this at this point he or she
is going to make a statement which is defamatory, if that statement itself is not
defamatory, or if it is defamatory, it is within the protection of article one hundred
five, then clearly, it's not a conspiracy within the meaning of one hundred twenty (a)
then.
but on the other hand, those who entered into that conspiracy, with him.
first, the conspiracy is hatched, consciously, to go and make that speech.
so on the one hand is the defamation contained in the speech, but anterior to
that is the conspiracy to commit.
defamation. defamation or hate speech under one hundred and fifty three (a).
but there is no conspiracy to commit a defamation, because there is no defamation on
the floor of the house. i'm sorry, my lord. the conspiracy is to defame.
you are saying that the conspiracy is independent of.
my lordship, please.
.the actual act.
the conspiracy is to defame individual x. the conspiracy is to make a hate speech.
anyway hypothetical, we are really on a hypothetical, but i'm not sure you are entirely
right on the interpretation because the act itself is not illegal, there cannot be a
conspiracy.
my submission is the act is illegal if you conspire to make a hate speech
or to defame, and then go ahead and do it.
and that hypothetical example has to be given because now we are trying to stretch
this to the fact that bribery is anterior.
therefore, it is necessary, my lords, to illustrate the fallacy of that approach by giving
this example.
it would depend on the nature of the offense.
so far as, i'm not expert in criminal law, but so far as conspiracy one
hundred and twenty (a) is concerned, agreement, which is illegal itself, is sufficient as a
crime.
nothing more need to be one hundred and twenty, there are judgments saying that.
so therefore prior to the participation in the parliament, if an offense prescribed is complete
at that point of time, then you can be prosecuted.
on the other hand, take the example of defamation.
defamation is complete on the happening, the effect of it on the reputation of the
person.
though there is a conspiracy prior to the proceedings of the house, eventually, the offense
comes into place only upon the utterance in the parliament and the effect of the
utterance on the people.
there, in that cases, then the immunity, perhaps attached but in one hundred and twenty
case, one hundred and twenty (a), that you are talking about, the offense is complete
in the type of a conspiracy before the proceedings have commenced.
in other words, while the house is not concerned with the conspiracy per se, it's
concerned with the effect of the conspiracy and that will take care of the decision
to be made.
when it comes to conspiracy, if it construes a criminal offense then the law will
be set in motion.
so, the house is concerned with that offending part of the speech or the vote
and the resultant action to be taken by it.
that they, only to that action you can take note of the conspiracy, to that
action it will find fault with the speech made or the voting made only for
arriving at its own conclusion.
that will not take away the role of the prosecution agency in a case where,
offence is made out.
one hundred and five is not meant to be protected such a contingency.
the idea is to maintain the sanctity of the house. we can't stretch it too
far to say that what has happened earlier even assuming an offense made out, then
we should not, immunity will apply.
offense of bribery is in contemplation of a vote to be given in the house
or cast in the house. this brings it within.
the protective ambit.
the protective ambit of privileges and immunities, notwithstanding the anterior criminalities.
that's your formulation.
lordship please.
and therefore, also my submission my lords, which is a part of this that you
can't make a distinction between different types of criminal offenses because always conspiracy abetment, et
cetera are also part, are also offenses.
and therefore we can't say, we are only looking at bribery because it's shocking our
conscience.
we can't compartmentalize it.
anything which is criminal is criminal.
that's how we have to view it.
an attempt was made to remove defamation from the criminal law.
that part of the majority judgment is to be diluted.
that doesn't affect because it doesn't affect my case.
first proposition you are giving up then because we need to dilute the majority judgement.
the first proposition.
on that count.
the first proposition is in the context of my submission of relating to the facts
of my case.
because of vote.
this counting needs to be diluted because the majority judgment turns on that.
ajith singh. speech made, not made.
ajith singh is let off because there was no speech made.
lordship, please, i am happy so it would have to go now.
i am happy if ajith singh had also got the protection, to that extent, by
my agreeing.
to that extent i am only happy that the late ajith singh. to that extent
the judgment needs to be modified mister ramachandran. to that extent it needs to be
modified.
the judgment needs to be modified.
that logic would have to go.
so your first proposition goes.
i still don't concede that my first proposition goes.
my first proposition may be refined.
your first proposition needs to be diluted.
what happened to my first proposition may be refined, needs to be nuanced.
by the way does anybody knows what happened to the prosecution of mister aijt singh
thereafter?
what happened actually in fact?
i'll only to academic discussions in the court. reality what happens, god only knows.
bribe givers were acquitted.
because the lawyers have the last laugh on the jain hawala case ultimately, what happened
to the prosecution?
there is no escape from pc act ramachandran. now, my lords, my second point.
i'm making basically three points in my rejoinder. my second point is with regard to
parliament and house of parliament, legislature and house of legislature. because my lord, the chief
justice today emphasized a different aspect of it because one hundred five (ii), as i
had also pointed out in my submission uses legislature in the first limb and house
of legislature in the second limb.
so what is the second submission?
my submission is that the significance of this distinction, is not only what my lord,
the chief justice emphasized in his observations earlier in the day that house of legislature
authority pertains to what is published outside.
that was the emphasis which, my lord, the chief justice laid.
but this distinction is also important in the context of my submission that voting as
a member of the legislature for the rajya sabha election is a vote given in
the legislature though it is not in the house of the legislature, and let us
not, and therefore the submission of the learned attorney general is misplaced when he, with
respect, contends that this is not the kind of vote which is protected under the
immunity.
i pointed out article eighty of the constitution, as an mla it is my constitutional
duty to vote.
it's an integral part of my duty as an mla to vote.
and let us not look at this only from the point of view of an
election of an mp or two to the rajya sabha. voting in the legislature and
in parliament as against in the house of parliament, also happens in the presidential and
vice presidential election.
that is also not done in the chamber. it's done in the lobbies.
and your lordship will recall, in nineteen sixty nine, a president of india, was elected
as a result of a conscience vote, whereas against the official candidate of a ruling
party.
mister giri. vv giri, became the official party?
neelam sanjeeva reddy was the official candidate.
now therefore, voting, this vote whether it was my client sita soren's vote for an
ex rajya sabha mp ex or whether it was a congress mp's vote for vv
giri or neelam sanjeeva reddy. they are both of the same character.
these were votes in parliament. these were votes in legislature and my lord, the same
protection must arise.
my reason for emphasizing, the presidential, vice presidential poll is that these are not just
stray rajya sabha elections.
vote lordship please.
yes. finally, my lord. when i contend before your lordships, to take note of the
majority's caution that this can be misused that passage in justice bharucha's judgment, which i
read out my lord. it is not something alarmist, mere possibility of misuse, mere possibility
of misuse is not something which i appreciate the courts will not countenance because the
courts are there to protect.
but the possibility of misuse going back to blackstone. blackstone is not quoted by justice
bharucha, but the same thought is echoed in justice bharucha's judgment, is the very basis
of privilege.
misuse of the criminal law inter alia apart from other law is the historical basis
of privilege and therefore, if your lordships keep that in mind, your lordships are not
surrendering to the forces of fear, but your lordships are only recognizing the historical and
constitutional basis of this particular privilege we are talking about.
i'm grateful, and as i've already said, we have a strong case on merits for
reasons which we have set out in our information.
thank you very much for assistance.
thank you mister attorney, mister patwalia, sankaranarayanan. thank you for a very pleasant hearing.

thank you very much.
thanks to the amicus. and the amicus. mr solicitor also, thank you.
attorney as well.
thanks. very grateful.
