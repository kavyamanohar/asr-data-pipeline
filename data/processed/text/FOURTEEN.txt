item seven hundred and one.
before my learned senior starts, there is a small request, regarding the scope of the
reference.
as your lordship have, now, broadly seen the papers.
the reference is whether article thirty (one), the expression used 'establish and administer' is disjunctive
or otherwise, where this basha will have to be addressed.
but the written submissions which all of us have received from the petitioner is as
if azeez basha is being reconsidered, as if this bench is sitting as an appellant
bench.
i have my lord, in my written submissions narrated, only a minute.
if i may.
my lord, a capacity of a solicitor to interrupt and take the stage is legendary.
let us begin and he will answer.
and we will answer him.
this is not on.
this is simply not on.
if he has raised certain questions, we will answer that.
let doctor dhavan open, because once in about twenty minutes, we will know that the
ambit of his submissions is going to be.
then we will see as a matter of progress.
let doctor dhavan open.
it is our request and we have decided to be decent.
we will be.
both individually on the issues, quite apart from being disjunctive or conjunctive, that's one part
of it.
but on the individual issues under article thirty, whether aligarh muslim university was administered or-
let's read and as or - or established.
on both those issues, the court ruled to say that it is neither administered by
minorities or established by minorities.
that correctness of the finding has never been referred, has ever been referred.
that's all that we wanted to point out.
that will be your submission.
that's all.
my lord, whether the reference is sustainable is an argument i'm going to make.
what is this my lord?
i've never seen this in the supreme court. we are a bench of seven, let
doctor dhavan open his argument.
as the matter progresses we'll understand what is the scope of the controversy, and then
we will decide, where.
this is simply unfair.
yes doctor dhavan, we will start.
in fact, it is fair.
we know what is the scope.
one person goes on air, basha. the other person says the reference is not maintainable.
we will address these issues.
you answer, you answer, and we will answer you all.
my only request, my lord, is this, there is a certain slack we might require
in your lordship's timing.
we appreciate, my lord, that this is the busiest court in the world.
you are overwhelmed in a way in which no court in the world is overwhelmed.
whether it's one hundred and thirty six or whatever it is.
the time that your lordship can give my lord, is very important, and i would
just say that in the light of what has been said, our reply is important.
in the three hundred and seventy case, our reply was curtailed my lord. if required
your lordship, may give us time.
that's my respectful submission.
my lord, i remember jl sanghi was asked to curtail his arguments.
krishna iyer rang me up in the evening and said - your item is number
one, please continue.
these are my lord, traditions and i know that the chief justice, and i've commended
it, is so patient in listening to arguments, it is admirable.
doctor dhavan we will.
thank you.
don't worry about the time.
ultimately, our conscience has to be satisfied that we have heard both sides fully.
right, right.
and our reply.
the reason why we set down time limits is, because then people have a broad
indication.
my lord, i understand.
there is no repetition.
your lordships are overwhelmed.
now my lord, let me begin by saying about the reference.
i want to read the two reference orders to your lordships, because the significant thing
in the two reference orders is this, that normally when a reference is made, the
points of reference are itemized by your lordships. this is not been done in this
case.
so i've taken the liberty, my lord, in my written submission of itemizing what draws
from the two reference orders.
the first in ' eighty one and the second in twenty nineteen.
so, let me take your lordships, straight away to those two particular orders.
because it's important, your lordship, should itemize what the point of reference is.
we get them in volume three-a, right?
three-a, absolutely.
show me both two hundred and nine.
i'm sorry.
i'm a luddite my lord. i'll have to use the printed text.
so much better now.
one day, my lord, i will learn, that's a promise.
my lord, kindly turn to.
i thought we could have started with this matter.
it should start with this matter.
i'm learning, i'm learning.
i am.
i appreciate this my lord. and when i interact with my colleagues, they're brilliant at
this in a way in which we never were.
anyway, kindly turned to.
what is it?
that's the pdf? two hundred and nine.
look, this was what said by a bench presided over by justice fazl ali. it
says - 'after hearing the parties we are clearly of this opinion that this case
involves two substantial questions regarding the interpretation.
(of article thirty (one), the present institution was founded in the year nineteen thirty eight
and registered under the societies act.
in nineteen forty, the documents relating to the time when the institution was founded shows
that while the institution was established mainly by the muslim community, but they were members
of the non-muslim community who also participated in the establishment process.
the point that arises is whether thirty (one) of the constitution envisages the institution which
is established alone with the participation for the factom of establishment from any other community
on this point.
there is no clear decision of this call there are some observations in azeez basha,
but these observations can be explained away.
another point that arises is whether the establishment of the institution it is registered as
a society under the slightly registration act.
its status is a minority change) [end of no audio] an institution changes in view
of the broad principles laid down in azeez basha. even several jurists including mister seervai,
have expressed the correctness of the decision of this court. since the point has arisen,
we think that it is proper, where a larger bench can consider the aspects fully.
we therefore direct that this case may be placed before the honâ€™ble chief justice for
being heard by a bench of at least seven judges so that azeez basha may
also be considered and the points that arise directly to the essential conditions or ingredients
of the minority institution, may also be decided once and for all'.
then a reference is made to the various criticisms, which the court noted.
'a large number of jurists, including mister seervai, learned counsel for the petitioner, mister garg
and interveners, dixit and kaskar, have also stated the this case requires reconsideration.
in view of the urgency that this matter may be decided as early as possible,
we gave liberty to counsel to mention it before the chief justice'.
so here, my lord, is a clear statement, of course, that reference was not made
eventually.
but we have now to consider the reference that was made by my lord, chief
justice gogoi. your lordship may come to two sixteen.
the point i'm going to make is there are so many things mentioned in this
reference that your lordships will have to formulate and we will assist your lordship to
formulate, what the points of reference really are.
maybe all these arguments - reference is bad etcetera.
can be looked at after the event.
now, two hundred and sixteen -'begins with azeez basha. in our mind, it's clear that
the community will have the right to establish and administer of their choice, meaning thereby
where a religious minority establishes an educational institution, it will have the right to administer
it.
an argument has been raised to the effect that even though the religious minority may
not have been established, it will still have the right to administer'.
when i get to azeez basha, my lord, i'll read all of it, but kindly
come to page two hundred and eighteen.
it's a very interesting comment your lordships have made, which really, in a sense takes
us much further where in paragraph two it is said -'the judgment of the allahabad
high court, which is under challenge, rejects the prayers made on account of the decision
of azeez basha'.
this is the effect of a azeez basha, that after nineteen sixty eight, it has
quelled all understandings of article thirty.
then a mention is made of anjuman-e-rahmania, which is the nineteen eighty one case, and
then your lordships will see in paragraph four, it mentions tma pai. what is the
effect of tma pai?
it's crucial, my lord, in our understanding of what this is.
your lordships will then come to page two hundred and nineteen, where a question was
raised in tma (pai and the question was never answered.
now my lord kindly turn to two hundred and twenty.
the said facts will show that the correctness of the question arising from the deficient
of this court in azeez basha has remained undetermined now, lord, the reference is made
to yashpal this is extremely important.
and i will show that to your lordships.
because azeez basha. says once there is an intervention of statute then it is established
through the statute, not by you.) now, yashpal my lord, looking at the ugc act,
which azeez basha refers to, but nevertheless.
ugc act, my lord. now, what do we do with yashpal and then over the
case two hundred and twenty one -'having regard to the background as stated above, when
the precise question was already referred to the seven judge bench, but not answered.
we are of the view that the present question set out above should be referred.
now, what is to be taken into account, my lord?
tma pai is to be taken into account, yashpal is to be taken in account.
yashpal, my lord, says that when you want to establish a university, it has to
be done by statute.
this is section twenty three of the ugc act as well.
now, the point would be, it means that wherever there is the establishment, by statute,
you are not entitled, to be a minority institution.
this will affect a large number of institutions, my lord, in this country.
your lordship is a chancellor, my lord of.
i want to stress that point because i don't think azeez basha has understood how
universities are administered.
now, what do we do with the reference?
you can pop up and say whatever you like, but, we have tried to make
my lord, some sense out of what this is.
i've done it in a small paragraph, and will your lordships come to my written
submission?
my learned friend says that in two hundred and twenty, azeez basha has to be
reconsidered as mentioned twice.
this is there my lord in the reference, but unfortunately that bench did not delineate
what the questions are, which normally, my lord, happens.
now come to my written submission.
of course, the order, the referring order by chief justice gogoi, brother justice khanna and
justice nageswara rao, refers to the questions which were formulated in justice fazl ali's original
order, says as well those questions were never answered.
no, there were two questions which were formulated by justice fazl ali. in fact, he
began by saying - two questions arise.
he didn't formulate them as one and two, but it's obvious that in the first
page, the learned judge has formulated the two questions.
but the very fact that it refers to tma pai and yashpal has to be
taken into account my lord. it's as simple as that.
now my lord, kindly.
these questions were formulated by justice fazl ali referring.
to some extent, to some extent.
but this court looked at the later decisions of this court. the later developments which
have taken place as well.
now my lord, kindly come to my written submissions.
this is volume one-a. because you have the two thousand four act which comes in.
then yashpal is.
tma pai tells us how do you define a minority.
tma pai doesnâ€™t deal with 'establish and administer', it certainly has some bearing on the
issue, because it does.
and its consequences.
because your lordships are always concerned with the consequences of an interpretation.
kindly come my lord, to my written submission, that would be volume.?
one-a. kindly turn to page seven where i've summarized.
i'm sorry.
doctor dhavan?
now after i. what i've read to your lordships. i've dealt that.
kindly come to page eight. one point five. to my mind, my lord, since yashpal
and of course, there's a national minorities act, my lord, which is very important, i
have my lord, indicated what the possible reference could be, and that your lordships will
find at the bottom of page eight.
may i read it my lord?
yeah. now at the bottom of eight, i've succinctly put what the reference should be.
'whether the decision in azeez basha is internally contradictory in its reasoning on facts and
law.
contrary to the authoritative decisions of this court, rendered nugatory by subsequent statutory changes, and
contrary to the constitutional dispensation from article thirty.
this covers my lord, the later portions and the earlier portions'.
now, here, my lord, i put the issues that arise from this.
the first is, was azeez basha correctly decided and whether it suffers from internal contradiction
and reasoning on facts and law?
this my lord, i will place azeez basha before your lordships. 'was. did azeez basha
need to be considered in the light of earlier and subsequent decisions of this court?
what is the effect of azeez basha in the future decisions of the allahabad high
court, which applies azeez basha completely and strikes down the statutory amendments through the eighty
one act'.
my lord, when we went to the allahabad high court, chief justice ray simply said,
this problem of article thirty and azeez basha is by a bench, authoritative bench, we
have to follow it.
there's nothing more we can do.
of course the judgment is piquant, but we are not at present my lord, in
appeal over the allahabad judgement.
i appreciate that my lord. we can certainly place it before your lordship, but i
don't think it's necessary.
maybe, that's in the light of your lordships decision, maybe my lord, that can be
done by the smaller bench.
now my lord 'what is the effect of the national commission of institutions act read
with the university grants commission. should azeez basha be reconsidered in the light of the
ncmi and read with ugc by yashpal'.
then my lord -'was azeez basha correct in accepting the antecedent historical data on amu's
muslim character, but denying its constitutional significance while deciding the issue of its minority status,
which is at variance with saint stephen ' s, proost and patro. my lord, and
parts of it.
then, 'is azeez basha contrary to the constitutional dispensation'?
my lord, that's the sixth point.
these are the issues that arise, and i've dealt with them in seriatim.
because we have to my lord, whether we like it or not call a reference
from the two reference orders.
now, my lord, i want to begin by saying before i go into the preliminary
objections that we want to raise.
my lord, i think your lordship, will bear in mind that india has a diversity
which is more than continents in any other country in the world.
your lordships, have listed in that.
they have listed only twenty two languages, in the eighth schedule. but in actual fact,
they are much more.
as you go across even my state of up, you will see the variation as
it goes, and they want to preserve that language, too loom my lord. that is
the basis of tma pai. therefore, your lordship, will bear in mind that this enormous
task before your lordships, which came about squarely places in talking of secularism.
and then there's this very elegant, elegant passage my lord, at the end, very evocative
my lord, but very important.
so, when your lordships, get into this question my lord, your lordship, is deciding something
that goes to the heart of indian secularism, and to the heart of the diversity
of this country, both in terms of language as well as religion.
this is so crucial to our understanding of the constitution. of course, in nineteen twenty,
there was no constitution. but subsequent developments have taken place.
in nineteen fifty, a constitution comes, ' fifty six the ugc act comes, the minority
act comes, and there's a load of decisions my lord, which say, look at the
historical antecedent.
azeez basha looks at it and says, it's now irrelevant because we have decided that
the act, in fact established what happens to that rich history, my lord. mister sibal
will also comment on it.
what happens to that rich history?
throughout the world my lord, there are minority state institutions.
your lordship, went to harvard. john harvard came from emmanuel college, my college.
and we still exchange with harvard. if you look at america across the board, and
if you look at india today, private institutions and minority institutions are the heart and
soul of indian education.
you can't deny it, my lord. and that is why justice kripal says - 'so
what if they have read it?
they don't lose the minority character'.
you can't withdraw recognition.
this is one of the points that is made in tma pai. (now my lord,
i come to a preliminary objection.
kindly come to page ten now this phenomenal.
i'm just lagging for your lordships when they reply to this.
we will want to elaborate in reply the question that people issue whether the union
of india, having accepted and defended the minority status of ali gardenu university, both as
a matter of fact and law, can be allowed to take a new stand that
is contrary) to its pleadings and affidavits in the present litigation, in the absence of
any change in circumstance, annuity.
the union of india has always defended the statute.
in azeez basha, they defended the nineteen fifty one and ' sixty five act. and
when we were in allahabad, and before this court, when your lordship gave a stay
order, the union of india took the view that azeez basha was wrongly decided, the
history should have been taken into account.
and how can it change its stance?
how can, because of a regime change.
how can my lord, we say, that because of the regime change, we change our
stance.
it can't be done.
i await the solicitor's response to all this.
and when that response comes, we will reply.
but just let me take you to one or two passages on page ten onwards.
what the union of india does in two point two -'in view of the foregoing
paras in general, and particularly in view of the judgment of the supreme court in
azeez basha. the union of india has decided to withdraw its earliest stance taken by
the government to support the minority institutions status of aligarh muslim university. the slp filed
in the supreme court in two thousand six, in support of the minority status of
amu may accordingly be treated as withdrawn'.
now, of course, your lordship has to give permission for this, that has happened.
we've responded to this as well.
then your lordships will see, i've said the union of india's.
we have taken, 'the petitions have been opposed by the union of india, and its
main contention is that the aligarh university established in nineteen twenty by the amu act
and that this establishment was not by the muslim minority.
but the government of india, by virtue of a statute, the ' twenty act, and
therefore the muslim minority could not claim any fundamental right to administer'.
so if you're not established, the question or administration doesn't apply.
sorry?
yes, my lord, in azeez basha, they defended the statutes.
now there is a change of regime.
till two thousand five, they take the view that this is right.
mister gopal subramanium appeared in the allahabad high court, both for the attorney general as
well as the government. he came here, my lord, we came before your lordships, the
stance in the stay order, at which some stage i will show your lordships, was,
'no, azeez basha is wrong and the judgment of the allahabad high court is wrong'.
so your lordship said that as far as the reservation is concerned, stop it.
and amu agreed.
but as far as the other things that you do, that is, within twenty five
miles of the kilometres of the mosque, you will keep your minority institutions and muslim
institutions at that.
then over the page and this i reserve for my right to reply.
i have given two decisions as to whether the stance of the government can be
changed or not.
and the decisions basically, say if there is a policy change, it's different.
but this is more fundamental, there's a constitution in place here.
and my lord. it's idle to argue that before this (reference bench, this is not
a contention.
between parties as the solicitor says it is my lord to bring to your lordship's
notice azeez basha. then over the page.
my lord, i've given the union of india's affidavit it says definition of university merely
recognizes a new amendment of eighty one that as the nucleus of the aligarh muslim
university, which is a historical fact.
but amu and mao are not one and the same.
i'll show to you.
your lordships. my lord the antecedent history the detailed negotiations) that took place.
now, there is some discomfiture in the select committee, which justice wanchoo points out.
but the select committee majority takes an entirely different view.
so, my lord, our view is that the union of india stance, is a defiance
of the parliament's recognition in nineteen eighty one that amu is indeed a minority institution,
is contrary to the pleadings and submissions made before the allahabad high court and this
honâ€™ble court. now, my lord, i need and remind your lordship of sanjeev coke, which
says that mere affidavits, my lord will not solve the problem.
then my lord, i sum up in two dot one two comma 'it is the
duty bound to defend and follow the will of parliament express to the nineteen eighty
one '.
the union of india is not going to defend it having defended it.
when my lord, 'it failed to file a justifiable ground for reversing their consistent stance,
since nineteen eighty one at the governmental level and before the honâ€™ble court in the
allahabad high court. in these very proceedings, its failure to state that no any new
material or legal developments to justify this stance is arbitrary, reasonable and (lacks bona fide.
in any event the union of india can best be a supporting respondent in these
appeals and would be a stop from adopting a stance that is contrary to its
intent and purposes in the amending act of nineteen seventy two.
and, of course, nineteen, it should say nineteen eighty one.
this my lord i'm flagging for your lordship census let them apply and then we
will rejoin because they have raised some fundamental question so this is a preliminary question.)
i will now go to it on merits.
i'm starting with azeez basha. but before that, my lord, may i take your lordship
to article thirty.
my lord, the heart and soul of secularism as far as minorities is concerned.
minority protection started in nineteen oh nine, when reservation was made, nineteen nineteen, nineteen thirty
five and, of course, our constitution. now have a look at the importance of article
twenty five to thirty.
this is the crux of the understanding of what has to be done in this
multi-diverse country, because take away the diversity, there are all kinds of assimilations that are
at present taking place in our country, but take away this particular aspect and the
entire colour of our constitution and governance changes.
now my lord kindly come to twenty five.
now, my lord twenty five and twenty six are important, and azeez basha went slightly
wrong in its understanding of twenty six.
in justice kripal's judgment of tma pai he says, twenty six will also give you
a right to establish institutions.
azeez basha says, since you're out in thirty, how can you have a right under
twenty six.
now, my lord, there are two concepts of secularism, my lord, in our constitution. the
first comes from twenty five (two) (a), where it says -'regulating or restricting the economic,
financial, political or other secular activity, which may be associated with ritual practice'.
this is where secularism is mentioned and this is the negative view of secularism, saying
that these rights will be subject to secular.
this is a very narrow view.
the wider view that your lordships, have taken on secularism my lord, which is writ
large over your lordships decisions, is what we understand as part of the basic structure.
the narrow view my lord, simply says you can regulate this activity.
then my lord, if your lordships, i have taken you through the twenty six.
twenty eight (three), is important, because it mentions aid and that you cannot, because of
the aid that there are some limitations on what you can do.
this is now fully explained in tma pai and not fully explained in basha. now
my lord, kindly come to article thirty.
i am not going into the controversies my lord, of twenty nine and thirty.
that twenty nine (one) is a limitation on thirty.
all that has been decided, it's not.
now come to one (a), we needn't bother about that my lord, but the main
provision of thirty - 'all minorities, whether based on religion or language' - this is
the diversity provision 'shall have the right to establish'.
this is important, establish what?
'and administer educational institutions'.
now, this has to be read conjunctively and no doubt about that.
but one point that your lordship, should notice is this, what is a minority?
is something anterior to this.
'establish and administer' are the rights that flow from the recognition of a minority.
it's very important that your lordship should settle this.
what is it that makes a minority.
in my view, my lord, there are three questions.
firstly, the question of origin.
did the origin come from and where mother provincial effectively is in contrast.
mother provincial says it does not matter even if a single financier comes in para
eight which i deal with.
that's enough.
all this azeez basha business of not ignoring the antecedent my lord, is wiped out.
the second question, my lord, is the question of nexus, where mother provincial and other
decisions take the view, that what you have to look at is whether they found
the institution or not.
and thirdly, my lord, is the numerical test in tma pai., kerala education did not
answer that question.
we now know that the numerical test, is in respect to the state.
of course, some of us who argued pai my lord, are not particularly happy with
this.
because we support justice ruma pal decision, then it depends on the nature of the
statute.
but in any case, the majority is in this.
then over and above that, my lord, we have to look at the intention of
the statute in question.
what azeez basha does, my lord. and i'll take your lordship to the statue.
it ignores the purpose of the statute.
the purpose of the statute is writ large that it is of a muslim character.
whereas it goes into the question of establish and administer, it ignores the purpose altogether.
now, i'll briefly indicate to your lordships what my broad argument on azeez basha is
going to be.
my lord azeez basha is.
i'm sorry.
my lord, it is always the wish of arguing counsel to know what your lordships
were whispering about.
nothing. it was some diversion, in a way connected with the matter.
of course, i realize.
even more so.
even more so.
one thing that i didn't lord emphasize in article thirty, is the words 'of their
choice'.
now, my lords, i'll briefly outline first what azeez basha does and then take your
lordships through the decision.
'of their choice' was introduced to indicate that you can have a perfectly secular education
being administered in a minority institution.
yes, of course.
therefore, we are not constrained to only propagating your religion or your language or your
culture.
you can have an engineering college.
you can have an it college.
that was the purpose.
what your lordships have done, is added two caveats to this, because there was a
fear that these institutions will become too insular.
i think that's your lordship's point.
we don't just talk about that.
what your lordships have done in sidhajbhai and in tma pai is, your lordships have
said that these institutions must be institutions of excellence.
that's very important.
and amu and all these.
our understanding of the constitution is, you must, whatever your minority character, must be institutions
of excellence.
therefore the court has held that any regulation which promotes the character of that institution
as an institution of excellence is permissible.
of course.
so therefore, you must pay minimum salaries to your professors.
if you don't, you will not be an institution of excellence.
the other caveat.
frank anthony, for instance.
.
a lot of decisions is this, that where the ordinary law applies, service law, electricity
law, whatever it may be.
there's no immunity from the application.
there's no immunity from that, and i make it absolutely clear that amu and the
other institutions must be institutes of excellence.
it goes to the core of raising the level of minority institutions.
and your lordships have done this consistently on these two points, institutions of excellence and
ordinary law will apply to.
but the moment you say, recognition will not be given to you tma pai says
this is not all.
funding, affiliation, my lord, all that will be impediments.
i must say my lord, that in accreditation amu has been given a plus in
its excellence.
now my first point about azeez basha is this, azeez basha says universities can be
a minority.
this is at page eight hundred and forty eight.
i'll take your lordships through it.
now universities can be a minority, and you say that if they are established by
statute, they have no protection, this is a contradiction.
because now my lord, as ever, universities can be established in only two ways.
royal charter, which doesn't apply, applies to high courts, but nobody else and statute.
section twenty three of the ugc act, which is noted by azeez basha says it
must be by statute.
at the same time, it takes the view that if you are statutorily established, then
you are established by the statute and not your antecedents.
the second is azeez basha recognizes the background and antecedents role that the mao college
made in building this institution.
this does at page eight hundred and forty nine.
i'll show to your lordships. and it is said, it is clearly muslim. the third
point that i want to raise before your lordships, because i want to take your
lordships to the act of nineteen twenty and of course, the act of ' eighty
one.
it ignores completely the purposes of the act.
so all the provisions that actually deal with its muslim character are totally and completely
ignored.
now my lords, there is one thing, and your lordships will appreciate that, azeez basha
does not wholly understand how universities are run.
it mentions the governor general, it mentions a rector. universities my lord have a dual
system.
firstly, and your lordships will appreciate this as chancellor, and just that you will supervise
if necessary, you will inquire all that is written my lord. for example, in section
seven of the bangalore, it's there in nujs, it is there in sanchi. so one
of aspect my lord is the external institutions, that are kind of suo moto ombudsman.
the second part is the statute itself in the institutions of the minority.
the emphasis in azeez basha that the rector has this enormous power, is unfounded.
in all universities, rector later became the visitor.
in all universities the chancellor, the rector or the visitor has this supervisory power, and
that will not my lord interfere at all with the minority status.
my next point is that azeez basha ignored the alternative meanings to establish.
this is relevant for our understanding of mother provincial. it also understands but misunderstands the
importance of recognition.
it says recognition, why is that?
that takes everything away, and you become really nothing more than an institution of government.
these are the broad arguments my lord. because azeez basha takes a very narrow view
of article thirty.
now, my lord, may i take your lordship, to azeez basha. volume my lord, three-a.
your lordships, turn to three-a. we feel my lord, it was so much better to
handover the books.
so much better this way.
i don't know.
there's no time spent in handing over books.
no, but the point is, one went straight to the point, and then the books
came out.
so there was a continuity that we had, which is somewhat broken but that doesn't
matter my lord. i told your lordships, i'm a luddite and i'm amazed that your
lordships' dexterity.
now my lords, page three of three-a, is where the headnote is.
from the headnote itself, which i won't read out because i'll read from the judgment.
it goes into the antecedent history and says it's very important and then ignores it
because the nineteen twenty act is there.
but let me take your lordships, to the judgment itself.
now my lords, page seven.
the union of india's stance, my lord, was that it's not a minority institution but
also it defended the statutes of nineteen fifty one and ' sixty five, which were
before the court.
now my lord, there have been further developments.
we have the nineteen eighty one act. how can you now say, the nineteen eighty
one act. i mean, i can understand that the allahabad high court knocked down three
provisions of the amu act because they said it was a huge separation of judicial
power.
now, my lord, the chief justice has dealt with this in pavitra ii. i won't
go into greater detail about it.
did ' eighty one act change the basis or was it huge separation of judicial
power.
in knocking down the preamble in two sections which i'll show to your lordships. in
actual fact, they said it's a huge separation of judicial power and it's now next.
now my lord, kindly come to page eight.
here is the history of the establishment and it says, it's necessary to understand it.
i'll give your lordships of fuller account.
i won't take your lordships through it.
nineteen seventy syed ahmad khan says - the muslim community is neglected.
then my lord, there's a whole list of negotiations which i'll show to your lordships.
he wanted liberal education to muslims. then he says, in eighteen seventy two, the mao
was established and then my lord, in sequence of activities, a school was opened then
lord lytton laid the foundation stone.
the mao college was established thereafter, and it is a flourishing institution by the time
of syed ahmed khan. then, my lord, at the bottom of that page and your
lordship, has to see that, long negotiations took place that's the last three lines on
that page, between the association and the government of india, which eventually resulted in the
establishment of the aligarh. now, that is the antecedent history, we have to view it
in the light of saint stephen ' s, the antecedent history is important because your
lordships, will see that even saint stephen's was in fact a constituent college under a
statute, all our deemed universities are actually, as mister dwivedi pointed out to the court
in yashpal, by or under a statute.
if azeez basha is taken at its limits, it could destroy the entire system.
now -'resultant, it is mentioned that before a large sum of money was collected by
the university, as the government of india made it a condition that r's. thirty lakhs
must be collected for the university before it could be established.
further seems that the existent mao college was made the basis of the nineteen twenty
act for the administration of the university.
along with the properties and funds attached to the college, the major part of which
was contributed by muslims'.
this is the antecedent history and justice wanchoo recognizes this.
but he says, i am sorry, the nineteen twenty act will go by the establishment
and that's the end of it.
then my lord, 'the preamble says it is expedient to establish and incorporate a teaching
and residential muslim university and to dissolve the societies under the society registration act, which
are known as mao. aligarh and muslim university transferred to vest in the university, all
the properties and rights of the societies and the muslim universities foundation.
but this is important because a continuity was established between the pre nineteen twenty act
and the nineteen twenty act. this continuity is fundamental to our understanding.
justice wanchoo realizes this but then ignores it.
now, my lord, kindly come to section three.
it also mentions my lord, opposite place h that section four dissolved the mao college
and muslim university association and all the property movable, immovable and all rights and powers
of the privileged were.
the funds were transferred through aligarh. this is the continuity in section four.
how can you ignore it?
mao is now being transformed by section four.
of course, earlier, because of section twenty three of the act, the court, which was
big body, had all muslims only.
that was amended in nineteen fifty one.
now, my lord, go over the page.
kindly come to place c. these provisions will show that the three previous bodies legally
came to an end and everything that they progressed off was vested in the university
by the nineteen twenty act. of course it was.
but the continuity and nowhere you will see in the act, as i'll show to
your lordships, the muslim character.
section six is important because justice wanchoo finds fault with the fact that the degrees,
etcetera., will be recognized by the government.
this is precisely what your lordships have said in kerala education and others.
recognition must be given.
then your lordships will see thirteen.
thirteen as i pointed out is a misunderstanding of university education because university education is
based on two templates.
the external template which is chancellors, visitors, visiting board and then it is provided that
the governor general will be lord rector, this becomes visitor later on.
and then it mentions at the bottom of the page that the lord rector shall
give notice to the university of its intention to cause an enquiry.
you said university education is based on two templates.
one was the external.
and the internal.
and the internal would be the internal management of the university.
how would you define?
it would be how the university runs.
this template is important and i might mention, since your lordship is a chancellor of
these universities.
look at section seven of the bangalore act and the calcutta act. then my lord,
your lordships will see section fourteen, which is now no longer there.
but the important point, my lord, is at e. i'm sorry, my lord, my learned
friends want me to read c. the provisions clearly are putting out the final control.
it's not a final control.
in the template, it is a supervisory control.
may i sit down for two minutes my lord?
mister dhavan. there's no difficulty.
you don't have to stand and argue.
i noticed that mister parashar and your lordship said he could sit down.
i know.
i remember that.
and he said - no. so i must resist my lord and survive this time
up to lunch.
you can sit down.
doesn't matter.
doctor dhavan, this is because of you are lower back issue, please sit down and
please sit and argue.
it's perfectly fine.
it might aggravate.
out of concern i am saying.
and you can move the podium aside.
you can move the podium aside and you can have a seat and you can
come on the side.
thank you.
in fact if you have a special chair in your office.
i didn't know that this is an issue with your back.
you could have brought the chair here and sat in the chair and argued.
it's so much more comfortable.
no, it's very kind of your lordships. one must suffer in the traditions of this
court.
may i just sit down and place this my lord?
yes. he has a lot of courage.
he's been very unwell.
anyway. those things should not be told to the court. now my lords, kindly come
to section twenty three (two).
the supreme court, the supreme governing body would exercise all the powers provided by the
nineteen twenty act, that's page twelve, placitum c. this is the distinction between external and
internal.
it's a misunderstanding of how universities are run.
sir ashutosh was chancellor, my lord, of calcutta and he took a very prominent view
in developing calcutta's institutions at calcutta university. now, i come to section twenty three.
your lordships will say see that in the nineteen twenty act only in muslims were
members of the court. the court is the supreme body.
now my lord, i've already dealt with section twenty four, twenty five.
what is said my lord, between place f and g is a little sentence- 'this
provision clearly shows that the final power rested with the governor general'.
now, my lord, that's the chancellor and of course his role completely went, my lord,
because he appointed only the first vice chancellor, et cetera.
but somebody had to do it.
now my lord, the whole import of this is at the page thirteen, at the
bottom.
'if anything, some of the important provisions to which we have already referred shows that
the final power in almost every matter of importance was in the lord rector and
the governor general and council'.
now this is misunderstanding the template.
the rector disappeared and became the visitor. do visitors have that kind of right to
supervise?
very importantly so, my lord. then my lord if your lordships will come to place
c my lord. so my lord the internal part is mentioned in fourteen, but i
come to place c. the annexure to the nineteen twenty act gave the names of
foundation members of the court numbering one hundred twenty, who were all muslims and who
were to hold office for five years.
then section nine was deleted.
now come my lord to page fifty.
the next substantial change was made with the proviso of twenty three (one).
this is done in nineteen fifty one my lord, where, while the court becomes the
supreme body, it need not be all muslims. now my lord, there is a decision
of this court in gandhi faiz-e-aam. krishna iyer, my lord, was a dissent.
that the fact that you place other people on your board doesn't mean that you
lose your minority character.
just as justice das says, sprinkling of in tma pai. i'll show my lord those
judgments as far as required.
then my lord if your lordships will come at sixteen, place f. but i must
say i'm more relaxed my lord. i'm very grateful for your lordships. sorry. i apologize.
now my lords, kindly come to f. 'we shall proceed' - that's the third line,
just opposite l - 'on the assumption that the present petitions that muslims are a
minority based on religion'.
had he looked at the entire act my lord he would have realized what the
purpose of the act was.
now my lord, if your lordships will come over the page, we come.
so my lord there is really no dispute that they're a minority and azeez basha
says so in so many words.
we accept that it's a minority.
we accept a connection with mao. mao, my lord, was just the.
amu was just the alter ego, my lord. it is continuity of the mao act.
now my lord kindly come to page eighteen.
page sixteen and seventeen, they say that words 'establish and administer' must be read conjunctively.
i'm coming to that.
of course my lord. but as i said, these are the rights that flow from
article thirty.
the indicia of what is a minority.
numerically, historical circumstances, the nexus which saint stephen's and others see, that is the important
aspect of establishment, which goes to recognizing a minority institution.
establish and administer on the rights that follow.
so now my lord, seventeen.
your lordships will see it at a -'the words 'establish and administer' must be read
conjunctively.
it reads, to give the minority to administer an institution provided as it has been
established by, provided it has been established by it'.
so the more important point is establishment and the right to administer will flow from
it.
that's important, my lord, because justice wanchoo recognizes.
but where does amu, where does it get knocked out.
on the first stage.
you were established by statute.
so he says, where is your right to administer?
it's not there at all.
then my lord there is.
now this my lord is all conjunctive and this i won't go into that.
now, my lord the three questions on the top of eighteen.
'in azeez basha was whether it was established by the minority, first question.
whether it was a right to administer ever vested in the minority, and even if
the right to administer properties came to be to university, the minority before the establishment
of aligarh university, whether it had surrendered, it has been surrendered when the aligarh university
came to be established'.
now, there's a very interesting at c, just top of c, that paragraph.
'before we do so we would like to say educational institutions are of a very
wide import and would include university'.
now, this is a contradiction.
on the one hand, you say if it's established by statute, then you have not
established it, and this is a far reaching consequences and then ugc act specifically says,
you must do it by statute and by no other method.
and then my lord, 'this was not disputed on behalf of the union of india,
and therefore it establishes, it may be accepted that a religious minority had.
' so, my lord, i'm sorry.
now, i was at eighteen.
that there are very and would include university.
now, this is fundamentally important for the future and what azeez basha lays down.
if universities can only be established by statue, then the first part of azeez basha
says-' you have not established it'.
on the other hand, universities are part of the minority character.
and the union of india accepted that a religious minority has the right to establish
a university.
fundamentally, my lord. now, we come to the famous saint david's college, when i show
seervai to your lordships, he says, one line seems to have been relied upon.
now we have looked at it carefully, the reason why david's college was decided in
this way was, that although it had the right to confer degrees, it was not
recognized by royal charter.
so this is my lords the support from saint david, which i'll show to your
lordships, if required.
and this has been a stinging controversy raised by various jurists.
then my lord, kindly come to the important part of the university grants commission at
the bottom of that page.
it says at h, my lord -'the importance of recognition depended on the will of
the government cannot be minimized'.
now, all the decisions on article thirty say that you cannot hold back recognition.
so, section six is right.
now at the bottom of that page - 'it was only in nineteen fifty six
that section twenty two of the ugc lays down - the right of conferring degrees
shall be exercised by a university established or incorporated by or under a central act'.
when we were arguing yashpal, mister dwivedi made the very important point that this must
be read conjunctively that is established and incorporated.
then, kindly come to b. 'it was only thereafter that no private individual or body
could grant a degree in india. therefore, it was possible for the muslim minority to
establish a university before the constitution came in force, though the degrees would not be
recognized'.
now, my lords, where are we now?
because we have to take into account the ugc. what is azeez basha's implications?
on the one hand, you said, 'universities can be minority'.
on the other hand, you say if it's established, i'm sorry you have not done
it.
then my lord, kindly come next paragraph.
there was nothing in the nineteen twenty act to prevent the muslim minority if it
shows to establish a university.
this is wholly incorrect.
it couldn't have.
could only happen by charter or statute and this is true, my lord, of many
acts that we see in that area.
the nineteen twenty two delhi act which makes, for example say, saint stephen's of the
constituent college.
'but if it did so, the degree was not bound to be recognized by the
government'.
well, this is now history.
you have to recognize it.
recognition cannot stand in the way of a minority character.
then my lord it says -'in the absence of recognition of the degree, it may
not have attracted students.
and that is why we find the constitution came into force.
most of the universities were established by legislation'.
incorrect, all the universities were established by legislation. now, my lord. then - 'aligarh university
were also in the same way established by legislation provided the section six the degrees,
diplomas and other distinctions granted or conferred by person deemed university shall be recognized as
are the corresponding degrees, diplomas and other academic institutions.
then my lord, 'it is clear that even though the muslim minority could have established
at aligarh in nineteen twenty university, it could not insist that degrees granted by such
university should be recognized'.
this is only at variance with the jurisprudence of your court. recognition and affiliation, tma
pai says, 'cannot stand in the way of the minority character'.
then he says at g - 'the enactment of section six therefore, when the aligarh
university was established by section six, it's degrees were recognized and the institution was brought
into existence, which could not have been brought to existence by private individual body or
individual could not insist upon recognition.
but the more important part is the enactment of section six is a very important
circumstance which shows that the aligarh university, when it came to be established was not
established by the muslim minorities.
for the muslim minority could not insist on the recognition'.
this is all passe'.
your lordships have said otherwise.
recognition is fundamental.
when your lordships look, my lord, at the colleges and the schools, when they were
denying recognition, your lordship said, no, no, your recognition cannot stand in the way.
then my lord very important is h. 'it is true, as it is clear from
the nineteen twenty act that the nucleus of the allahabad university was the mao college
which was till then a teaching institution under the allahabad university. the conversion of that
college, if we may use the expression in the university, was not by the muslim
minority.
it took place by virtue of the nineteen twenty act'.
this, my lord, is the crucial finding.
i take your lordships now to d, my lord. now my lord at d -
'it may be that the nineteen twenty act was passed as a result of the
efforts of the muslim minority.
but that does not mean that aligarh university came into being under the nineteen twenty
act and was established by the muslim minority'.
this is the error.
all along you are saying universities can be minority institutions and at the same time
you are saying the intervention of a statute will deny you that status.
then my lord, i come to this.
no, no, it says my lord, that fundacio incipience and fundacio proficience.
my lord this means the incipience means at the process of granting recognition.
and my lord the proficience means my lord perfecting it.
in actual fact, it's wrong to rely on only the latter.
because amu was there at the beginning, that is at its inception and also my
lord, later on when it was established.
now, my lord, we come to a very interesting area at the bottom of page
twenty.
what does the word 'established' used in article thirty mean?
if your lordships will go over the page.
it gives the different meanings of the us to settle firmly, to fix unalterably, to
establish justice, to make or form as to establish a uniform rule of nationalization.
to found or create, to regulate, as congress shall have the power to establish.
to found, recognize, confirm or admit'.
now my lord, it mentions the oxford dictionary and it says establishment has a number
of meanings to ratify, confirm, to settle, to found, to create.
the big criticism of mister seervai and others is there was a plethora of meanings
that you could establish, use, but you didn't.
you picked up one which is there my lord. 'we are of the opinion that
the purpose of article thirty (one) means to bring into existence so that the rights
given to the minorities is to bring into existence as education, and if they do
so, to administer it.
we have therefore to see what happened in nineteen twenty and who brought the university
into existence'.
now, my lord, mother provincial, which is a six judgment, bench judgment, confirmed by tma
pai uses the word 'found' which i showed to your lordship. it's fundamentally different.
my lord. what is the distinction between 'found' and 'bring into existence'?
my lord, bring into existence according to, according to the judgment is to incorporate.
whether by charter or otherwise.
'found' means you take into the antecedent circumstances and mother provincial at para eight says
that even if a single individual, philanthropic does this, it will be found.
we're not in the process of just a legal interpretation of thirty.
we're in the process of looking at the entire process, and he's absolutely right in
looking at those latin terms, at the instance of preparation and at the instance of
founding.
now my lord, kindly come to the history again at placitum f. 'from the history
we have set out above, it is clear that those in charge of mao college,
the muslim university association and the muslim university foundation committee were keen to bring into
existence a university at aligarh. there was nothing in the law to prevent them'.
but that's all true.
but if we, say, 'found', the connection can be seen between the past and the
present.
then comes a very important part at h. it may be accepted for the present
purposes that mao college in the muslim university education association and the muslim university foundation,
were institutions established by the muslim minority.
then over the page, it says it was under then.
'but if the mao college was to be converted into a university whose degrees were
bound to be recognized by government, it would not be possible for those who were
in charge of mao college to do so'.
we come to the same conundrum, that to establish means to establish by statute.
you accept everything about the minority background.
then, my lord, if your lordships will come to placitum f. so their lordships did
not examine the fifty one and sixty five act properly.
now, come to f, 'nor do we think the provisions of this act can bear
out the contention, that it was the muslim minority which was administering aligarh university, after
it was brought to in existence.
it is true that the proviso to twenty three (one) says, no person other muslims
shall be a member of the court which was declared to be the supreme body
and was to exercise all powers.
we have already referred to the fact that the select committee was not happy about
this provision and only permitted it in the act out of different issues of prepondering
muslim opinion'.
also, the select committee if the majority is there, how does the minority discomfiture.
the important point here is if you prove you established, then only you'll administer.
it is not necessary, that the governing body must necessarily have muslims, gandhi faiz-e-aam. nor
is it necessary that all the students should be muslims, kerala education bill and tma
pai. then, if your lordships, after noting that the members of the court, the supreme
body, shall all be muslims, this is what is said at place c on page
twenty three.
'it will then be seen that besides the fact that the members of the court
had to be muslims, there was nothing in the act to suggest that the administration
was in the muslim minority aspect'.
we have to see the act, my lord. the two templates that i have given
to your lordships, the external template and the internal template.
then if your lordships will skip all this about article twenty six and come to
one part twenty four (f), 'but the right under twenty six will only arise by
the institution is established by religious domination.
it is in this event it can claim to maintain it'.
now, tma pai specifically says, ' twenty six is right'.
and you say 'you can't prove establishment, therefore your right disappear'.
then, my lord. i won't trouble your lordships with.
twenty seven, my lord is important.
my lord, this was an argument based on article nineteen.
but what is important if we see the act, my lord, there is a transition
in section four from mao college surrendering it's rights.
so my lord, we have mao college, all its property goes.
the old students who are there, have to sit the exam.
this continuity, according to this judgment is broken by the nineteen twenty act, and therefore
we come to place c. 'therefore, when the constitution came into force, there was no
property which was held by the muslim minority.
as such, for the property vested in the corporate body, the aligarh university. even assuming
that before nineteen twenty the property was surrendered, which was the property of the muslim
minority, nineteen twenty act put an end to their rights'.
my lord, transitions take place.
you have college.
it gives all its property.
it gives everything, and that is the continuity, which is broken now because of the
view of the nineteen twenty act. it is now established that you don't surrender your
minority status.
so these are the contradictions in tma pai. it was a muslim minority, muslims. in
basha. i'm going to go to the act now.
(these are the contradictions) in azeez basha. on the one hand it says a university
can be a minority.
on the other hand, it says if it's established by statute it can't.
it says the nucleus comes from mao, but we can ignore it.
now this my lord, is simply unacceptable in the light of saint stephen's and others.
the antecedent history is important.
and this dot sorry.
there are films on lip reading.
now my lord, kindly bear in mind that if azeez basha is right, no university
can be a minority.
it's contrary to legislative practice, but my lord no institution.
and a deemed university, which has been recognized as a minority was established in the
words of mister dwivedi, before yashpal. by or under the statute all deemed universities acquire
a statutory character.
now you say, it's established, a deemed university is established by or under, this implication
my lord is of importance, significance.
now let me take your lordship to the ' twenty act. volume three-g my lord.
pdf five.
i've learned a new phrase, my lord, pdf. is your lordship, there my lord?
first read the preamble.
'in the nineteen twenty act, as it was' there have been changes in eighty one.
'whereas it is expedient to establish an incorporated teaching in residential university at aligarh, muslim
university at aligarh and to dissolve the society's registered under society's registration act, which are
respectively known as the muhammadan anglo-oriental college and the muslim university association, and to transfer
and to vest in the university, all properties of the said societies and of the
muslim foundation committee'.
this is the continuity that is there.
now, my lords, just have a look at two-h which says - 'university shall mean
aligarh muslim university'.
then, if you come to three, i've already explained this governor general power is part
of the first template, not the second.
now the continuity, your lordships will see in section four.
here, the societies known as so and so, so and so shall be dissolved and
all properties of the movable and immovable and all rights and powers, the privileges of
those societies and all properties movable and immovable and all rights and privileges of the
muslim university foundation shall be transferred and vested in the university'.
this is the continuity recognized by this act. there would have been no act, my
lord, but for the foundation coming here.
then, my lord, 'all debt, liabilities and obligations shall be transferred to the university, which
is two.
all references in any activity, in any enactment to either of the said societies, shall
be construed as references to the university.
any will, deed or other document ' - i won't read all of it -
'shall be construed as if the university was therein named instead of the society or
committee'.
then, my lord, 'subject to any order of the court, the court may make the
buildings belonging to the mao shall continue to be known and designated immediately before the
commencement of this act'.
and finally, my lord, 'subject to the provisions of this act, every person employed immediately
on the commencement of this act in mao, shall hold employment under the university by
the same tenure, same terms'.
- and then my lord - 'as if the act had not been passed'.
now, what is section four?
how do we interpret it?
azeez basha interprets it negatively.
our interpretation, taking into mind the antecedent history which your lordships now accepts, has to
be taken into account.
saint stephen's has a huge para on this.
it says, even the motives, if you see it's in stephen's, even the motives show
its character.
now when siddharth shankar ray was arguing for the allahabad high court, he gave three
volumes on the motives.
i'm not going to trouble your lordships with that one.
but clearly there was an institution, which in continuity became a university.
then five, come to two, my lord. all this is ignored.
the muslim character is ignored.
five, sub-clause two, at the bottom of page six.
this is the purpose that has been ignored by azeez basha, which i mentioned in
the, when i basically my lord, summarized what was wrong.
and your lordships will see some of the points in the written submission, my page
fourteen to twenty five.
i'll quickly go through that when the time comes.
now my lord, what does two say?
'to promote oriental and islamic studies and give instructions in muslim theology and religion and
to impart moral and physical training'.
this is completely ignored.
then my lord, if you come on page seven to five (twelve) after it says
to do all other things.
at the bottom of that page it says 'islamic learning and muslim theology to promote
the interest of the students'.
this is the purpose of the act. seven, if your lordship comes to page seven.
twelve.
at the bottom of twelve.
i don't want to read the whole of it.
it's irrelevant.
what is relevant is islamic learning and muslim theology. now we come to section six.
one is the power to grant degrees and that six (a) shall be recognized by
the government. this is absolutely correct, my lord, interpretation of article thirty.
of course, it must be recognized by the government, as all the decisions say, otherwise
it will be valueless.
then, my lord, seven mentions how the government said thirty lakhs should be given by
as an endowment.
the nexus, my lord, is there because it is these institutions that have to provide
the thirty lakhs.
now over the page, there is an interesting provision which, of course, would not stand
in our feminist jurisprudence, my lord. i didn't want to disturb your lordship's thinking.
now come to eight, my lord. this won't stand, but it says something about the
women are exempted.
now, this will not stand, my lord, but the understanding at that time was this
was linked with muslim jurisprudence and now it is deleted.
then my lord, nine - 'shall have the power to make provided that instruction in
muslim religion shall be compulsory in the case of muslim students'.
this is consistent, my lord, with article twenty eight.
and then what happened is this was deleted, and a choice was given.
i remember when i went to school, whether i should attend church or not.
they had to get my father's permission, and i'm very grateful i did.
i wasn't in the choir, but like your lordships, i could sing christmas carols.
now, my lord. we also had to give a letter.
(the reason for showing) this, my lord, is what was the purpose of the act.
now, all these provisions my lord show what the purpose of the act was.
grant education to muslims. even forcing muslims my lord to attend.
now that, of course was deleted.
then my lord kindly come to twelve, which is very important, on page eight.
'the university shall, subject to the statute's power to maintain and establish intermediate colleges and
schools, within such limits of the aligarh district, as may be laid down in the
ordinances, for the purpose of preparing students for the university and may provide instructions in
the muslim religion and theology'.
its purpose, my lord, your lordship is very right, my lord, in saying that we
can't have these minority institutions with ghettos.
agreed my lord. they must be instruments.
institutions of excellence.
they must conform to the general law.
and nothing in this act takes that away.
then if your lordships will come to thirteen, kindly just'.
the governor general shall be rector'.
this is therefore, the rector who becomes analogist to the visitor. and that is where
my template comes in.
the external authorities and the internal authorities.
and my lord, i am informed by my colleagues that this is verbatim in all
the other acts, that is section thirteen (two) 'for the rector, read visitor'.
we've given some examples in volume four, that i will take your lordships. so, thirteen
and fourteen are taken care of and your lordship wanted to know what the internal
aspects were.
kindly come to page ten.
it says -'the following shall be officers'.
so the rector as the visiting part are not officers.
that's the external part in my template.
then my lord, 'the successors to the first chancellor shall be elected by the court'.
the court, my lord, under section twenty three was solely consisted of muslims. then your
lordships will see eighteen, 'pro vice chancellor shall be elected by the court'.
nineteen, 'the successor shall be elected by the court'.
twenty, 'the pro vice chancellor shall be appointed by the court'.
and now we come to the most important section, section twenty three.
twenty two, also my lord, you will see that the visitor is not an authority
of the court in twenty two.
now twenty three, is very significant and although noticed, the implications have not been worked
through.
twenty three reads the proviso.
as far as the proviso later went, but as far as the ' twenty act
is concerned, my lord, and the purposes of the act are concerned, it says, 'provided
that no person other than a muslim shall be a member thereof'.
and this continued till nineteen fifty one.
now this is very important when you come to administer, the court was hands on,
my lord, in the administration of the university, as is clear from sub-section two.
'the court shall be the supreme governing body of the university and shall exercise all
the powers of the university nor otherwise provided for in the statutes'.
so all this my lord is there with the supreme body which consists of muslims.
today there are non-muslims, my lord. but the point is, this was the tenor of
the nineteen twenty act. and then your lordships will see in two.
we're only concerned with the recommendations.
that's the end of two, my lord, of the lord rector. now, your lordships have
personal experience what it is it to be a chancellor, what is a visitor, etcetera.
your lordships may be non interfering, different from chancellors today.
one day that issue will come before your court also.
it's already.
already, i'm sorry.
we know that.
now look at three, 'subject to the provisions of this act, the court shall exercise
the following powers and perform the following duties'.
this is the supreme body consisting of muslims. 'making statutes and/or amending or repealing the
same, of considering ordinances, of considering and passing resolutions on the annual reports, of electing
such persons to serve on authorities of the university, such as prescribed by exercising such
other powers and performing such other duties as may be confirmed or imposed by this
act of statutes'.
the purpose of this is, administration will stay with the supreme body.
things have changed a little bit, my lord, but the supreme body part remains the
same.
then, my lord, i want to take your lordships to the statutes and ordinances. kindly
come to page twelve.
look at j on page twelve.
'the instruction of muslim students in the muslim religion and theology'.
the next is important, my lord, 'the establishment of intermediate colleges and schools and all
other matters by this act, which by this act are to be or may be
prescribed'.
now, this is referring to section twelve that within a radius of the mosque, you
should establish these institute.
then my lord kindly come to twenty eight.
come to the proviso at the bottom.
'provided that no statute dealing with the instruction of muslim students in the muslim religion
and theology shall require to be submitted or approved for approving'.
now, my lord. page fourteen, my lord. as an argument in sub-section five, the continuity
is established, those students who were in mao college may continue with their degrees.
now, kindly see the first statutes which are important.
the first statutes are there in page sixteen.
now this is in statute number eight, 'the court shall subject to the provisions hereinafter
contained consists of the following members'.
kindly come to clause two.
'the persons named in the annexure shall be foundation members'.
the annexure which i'll show to your lordship, was completely muslim. on page twenty four,
i'll come to that.
i don't want to get into all this.
so, the continuity is again established on page nineteen at the top of sub-clause three.
the graduates are there and who have been educated in the muhammadan anglo-oriental college and
are members of the association recognized for this purpose by the act. now my lord,
' twenty persons elected by the central standing committee of the all india muhammadan educational
conference'.
so, my lord, the link, my lord, with the foundation is here.
then my lord, kindly come to subsection six.
it's very important my lord, that this statute has to be read in a way
in which azeez basha did not read it.
and basha did not even look at this one and basha ignored the purpose, which
is writ large over the.
now my lord, kindly come - ' thirty persons, sub-clause six, thirty three, nine persons
to represent islamia colleges and other muslim educations not under the control of the university'.
and then my lord, ' fifteen persons learned, then nine persons learned in the muslim
religion and oriental studies'.
then my lord, kindly come to fifty.
'the executive council shall have thirty members'.
and three is important -' six are the members to be elected by the academic
council and twenty shall be elected by the court'.
now, remember the court my lord, is all muslim at that point in time.
we see in twenty three proviso my lord. then my lord, kindly come to twenty
two.
top of the page, 'two persons elected by the court'.
just mark these my lord. it's just, the purpose is self-evident and control is self
evident.
this is the academic council. now my lord, come to nineteen.
this was there in the original act, my lord and the original statutes.
i won't read all of nineteen, my lord, but kindly come to sub clause nine,
ten, eleven.
up to eleven my lord, all the way down.
what does it say?
what shall the departments be?
'sunni theology, shia theology, islamic studies, arabic language and literature, persian, urdu law'.
these are the few institutions in india that protect urdu, which as your lordship knows
in the eighth schedule symbol.
when i went to pakistan my lord, they have protected urdu in a way in
which we haven't.
of course i have a quarrel with the eighth schedule node.
english is now an indian language whether we like it or not, it is.
you look at the literature, you look at the poetry, you look at everything my
lord, all the proceedings of this court.
there's no point taking this anticolonial view that, english is as much in indian language
and developed as an indian language.
my friends in england, my lord, used to say, you have twisted the english language
and adopted it as your own.
which is true my lord. and as mister sibal points out, we do it better
than them.
but anyway my lord, that's not the point.
then, my lord, twenty one, at sub-clause two on page twenty three, graduates of other
universities who have been educated for the last two years at the muhammadan anglo-oriental college,
link again.
then my lord, kindly come over the page and we see the foundation members who
are part, my lord, of the court.
i won't read out the names, my lord, your lordship will just note them.
my lord. giving degrees through first calcutta and then allahabad. was affiliated to calcutta. affiliated
and also.
later on with allahabad allahabad, that's right.
from surat also.
there's somebody from surat. so my lord. i'm sorry.
minority college, it can get affiliated to a university and get a degree from there.
but in the case of a university, that cannot happen.
so if you want.
and without a university degree, you can't get employment.
so the real problem is if you say that, i should have continued as an
minority institution, nobody would have been employed.
because you have to get a degree, and that degree has to be recognized.
so if you are a university, it's the act itself that must confer that this
is the issue, at the heart of the problem.
section six.
but it was affiliated with.
correct. i am saying that as a college, but once you create a university, once
you create a university, it can only be done by statute.
there is no other way to do it.
basha says, you can have a university, but that degree will not be recognized.
but that's not the answer to the question, because if that is not recognized, why
would you have a university.
the importance of azeez basha is saying that universities are a part of article thirty.
it says so in so many words and that they have a right to be
recognized by a minority.
if that is so, we can't say tertiary education is beyond the scope of thirty.
now, the fact that there were degrees through affiliation is really a relevant topic because
of the negotiations that took place.
you take my property, you take my people, you take the students, you take everything
and the staff, because it was essential.
of course, there was no article thirty, but apply article thirty to azeez basha under
the ' twenty act. the whole point is the purpose of the act was muslim
in character and the purpose was nowhere to be found in azeez basha. now, my
lords, just note the pages.
i just want to take your lordship to my submission at page sixty one.
page?
volume one-a. what page mister dhavan? sixty one.
sorry, sixty.
shall i continue after lunch?
yes. we can resume after lunch.
my lord, i want to upload my submissions.
certainly, give them to the nodal counsel and make them a part of the compilation.
i'm sorry to keep all of you waiting.
actually, both justice khanna and i were in a meeting with the members of the
bar. senior advocates designation.
so, this is something very important to the bar. just the preliminary groundwork which has
to be done.
this point one must ask for a trade-off, as i mentioned earlier.
but i'm very fearful of that.
because, when we were arguing three hundred and seventy, they gave me water and i
said whiskey, and i got calls from singapore and all over india, was there whiskey
in the glass or not.
now, i want to take your lordships to the statement of objects and reasons. i'm
still on the purpose point, which is in volume four (a).
so, submission we'll look at.
please have a seat.
please have a seat doctor dhavan. look at the, look at the antecedent history of
the institution, one, the purpose of this statute and place the provisions of the statute
in the backdrop of the antecedent history and its purpose, and the mere fact that
the statutory provision somehow restricts what a minority institution could otherwise do in the absence
of the statute, would not be a ground to deny its status as an article
thirty institution.
and that's the point about recognition also.
and recognition and affiliation, you have to apply according to you for recognition.
otherwise, your degrees will never be recognised.
even for schools, where they depend on aid.
that's the submission, really.
even there, my lord. colleges too.
colleges. in fact, the whole part of inamdar relates to aided and unaided.
but provided, aided don't lose their minority character.
may i sit down?
i am very sorry.
yes, doctor dhavan. please have a seat.
volume four (a), page eighty eight.
you were reading actually, volume one (a), page sixty, i think.
i'll come back to that.
okay. so, we look at volume?
four (a) at page eighty eight.
your lordships have it?
yes. this is the statement of objects and reasons to the nineteen twenty act. four
(a).
my lords, the printed version is on eighty seven.
this is easier to read, because it shows the nexus that i was talking about.
the muslim university association, having requested the foundation of a university and certain funds and
properties being available to the said, it was proposed to dissolve the association and the
muhammadan anglo-oriental college, aligarh and to transfer the property of those societies to a new
body called the aligarh muslim university. the present bill is designed to incorporate this university
to indicate its functions, to create its bodies and to define its function.
it also secures the university the assurance of a permanent endowment to the government. and
the necessary part of control.
and the necessary part of control.
the university and the teaching residential type in accordance with the recommendations of the calcutta
university commission, the university will not include intermediate classes, but the university will have the
power to maintain intermediate dot to establish and maintain intermediate colleges and schools at aligarh.
they're almost there my lord. the degrees conferred will be recognized by the government. special
features of the university will be imparting for muslim religious education to muslims and the
inclusion of the department of islamic studies.
the bill provides for the making three, the general terms my lords on page eighty
nine of the bill and statutes have at various times been discussed with the representatives
or the muslim university association. that's the purpose.
now my lords i'll come to my written submissions.
i have my lord, in my summary, what the reference is really about, i've given
a short paragraph.
and then.
this is sixty of your written submissions?
this is my written submission.
also, when we use the expression, article thirty uses the expression establish and administer.
yes. now, there is no absolute standard of administration, that you must administer one hundred
percent.
and even that one hundred percent will be an elusive standard.
so, to make article thirty effective, we do not have to postulate that the administration
by the minority has to be an absolute administration.
in that sense today, in a regulated society, in a regulated state, nothing is absolute.
every aspect of.
virtually every aspect of life is regulated in some way or the other.
so, merely because the right to administer is regulated by a statute and to a
certain extent is not untrammelled, does not detract from the minority character of the institution.
that's the point we were making, i am grateful.
that is the essential point.
and then you add of their choice.
of their choice.
and it's establish, establish means, you must have founded it, as you said.
right. and that is a little more objective, but administration, i mean administration in that
sense there's no statutory definition or constitutional definition of the expression administer.
the courts have held what it means.
yes, the courts have held what administration means.
but if that right of administration is regulated itself by statute.
my lord, it can't be that it'll all be muslim, muslim, muslim. it just simply
cannot be, because after the constitution, all the universities have a liberal element in them.
please give representation to students, representation to teachers.
all that is there, my lords, in our university statutes.
these things are very clear.
you don't have to be administering only religious courses.
you can be administering a purely secular educational institution.
that's right.
that's one.
second, the law is not that you have to admit only students of your community.
you can admit students of all communities, without forsaking, because itâ€™s the light of establishment
and administration.
so, that's the second important ingredient.
and therefore, a minority institution does not lose that character according to your submission, merely
because various aspects of its existence are regulated by statute, including aspects relating to the
administration of the institution.
the state, in public interest is entitled to regulate, or the state legislature or parliament,
as the case may be, is entitled to regulate administration in public interest to ensure
that the conditions of service of the teachers are fair, that the staff of the
institution is not maltreated or not deprived of basic conditions of service.
there will be a variety of administrative requirements which the state can impose or the
minimum requirements for the allotment for the conferment of degrees, standards of examination, standards of
syllabus, the curriculum, that's all regulated by the state, but that does not detract from
the.
because that's applies across the board, irrespective of whether you are a minority or a
non-minority institute.
that's right.
and that's why i said, in the beginning, we accept that it must be institutions
of excellence and all the other regulatory features statute must apply.
with one caveat my lord, which is repeated again and again, that the right to
administer does not mean the right to mal-administer.
that's very important.
it comes in kerala education and then of course, my lord in tma pai. just
to get this purpose, et cetera, point dealt with, page sixty, because in our respectful
view, the reference has to be culled out by your lordships, because it mentions the
minority act, it mentions the university act indirectly.
so all that has to be culled out, we've said, was azeez basha right in
accepting the antecedent historical data on amu's muslim character, but denying its constitutional significance while
deciding the issue, of its minority status, which is at variance with st. stephens, proost
and patro. because they recognize antecedent history and just give it the go-by.
that point about nexus and continuity.
origins.
what is the origin?
in saint stephen ' s, they go right through the origins, and they even say,
you look at the buildings and they are quite clearly, christian in character.
now, my lord. mister dhavan, just one thing.
this you are raising it in the context of aligarh muslim university. what will be
the position post the enactment and enforcement of the constitution?
yes, of course.
with regard to universities which are established or founded thereafter?
what we have seen is that a large number of deemed universities under the ugc
act and the other statutes, they've been declared to be minority institutions, despite azeez basha.
and therefore, my lord, we have to look at this now also, as i will
point, through the constitutional lens, which is the question your lordship put to me, on
article thirty.
and, liberal education has to be combined with the religious education.
may i proceed?
yes. sixty, my lord. i have dealt with this, but just as a preface to
the next argument.
the muhammadan anglo-oriental college was the nucleus of the appellant university.
this is what basha says.
the founders had from the very beginning desired to incorporate mao colleges as a university
and grant degrees that are recognized by the government. the muslim community largely contributed the
funds necessary to incorp mao into a university. the founders had long negotiations with the
government to introduce a legislation and establish the incorporate.
the mao college. nonetheless, both courts have held now in allahabad that the appellant university
was not a muslim university.
the word establishment, is followed almost mechanically.
now, come to the antecedent history.
i'll run through it very, very fast.
i realise time is of the essence.
now my lord, come to sixty one.
we have divided the antecedent history into three phases.
from ' seventy to ' seventy seven, where the earlier idea of such setting up
a university for the muslim community for the betterment and advancement took place, and when
mao college was established.
from ' seventy seven to nineteen ten, the muslim community rallied to convert mao university,
and due to their efforts, the government, in principle, agreed to convert the college.
and from nineteen ten to nineteen twenty, where the founders from the muslim university actively
engaged with the government and succeeded in their desire to convert and incorporate the mao
college.
the vision, my lord, in the first phase.
i'll just quickly run through it.
your lordships may read it through because i don't want to go too much.
in the first phase, in eighteen seventy, sir syed established the committee for the better
diffusion and advancement of learning amongst muhammadans. the committee sought the views of the muslim
community as to why the muslims were not availing western education, and it was found
that this was due inter alia, lack of religious education, non-consultation with minority muslim. thus,
the idea of an educational institution managed by muslims for the benefit of muslims with
religious instruction received support.
then eighteen seventy one, the mao college is established.
over the page in sixty two, when the committee says, the object of the committee
shall be to collect funds towards the establishment of the college, particularly one for the
education of the muhammadans, as suggested by the central committee for better diffusion and advancement
of learning amongst muhammadans.
now, the committee resolved to establish the madrasa uloom, madrasa being a term for education,
at aligarh, which was subsequently inaugurated.
this was the first step realizing the vision of a university.
then my lord, the madrasa established the mao college.
and then, i'll just say what the governor general says.
from the seed which we sow today may spring a mighty decree whose branches like
the banyan of the soil, shall in their turn strike firm roots into the earth
and send forth the new vigorous sapling.
that is, the college may expand into a university.
so this is the other element my lord. as your lordship pointed out, it's not
just muslim education it has to be more than that.
and after the constitution, certainly so.
then, rules and regulations of mao say object of the college shall be primarily the
education of muhammadans. then first, only the muslim community was involved in the administration and
i mentioned the select committee and the rules for guidance of the mao college. over
the page my lord. the second phase, consists of the syed, seven. six dot one
comma seeking the government support for the muslim community and looking upon a degree as
a means to success and government jobs as recorded by altaf hussein hali in his
biography of sir syed. in further of the written address was presented to the college
fund committee to the viceroy, by far the greater portion of your funds and endowments
naturally derived from members of your race and creed, someday, when our endowments are richer
and our schemes are completed, we hope to ask to confer upon us the legal
status of an independent university. the funds, come from.
then my lords, that's recorded in this book, in eighteen ninety eight, a memorial fund
was created to raise funds for incorporating mao college, and this proved to be a
success.
one, twenty seven thousand, was an enormous amount in those days.
i remember my lord, the amount we used to get in my school, was only
r's. two per week.
it was huge.
so we have got to inflation prove this.
now, at the bottom of that page, those and other affairs by the muslim community
resulted in substantial funds collected for the establishment of the university. then there was an
address that was given when they met the viceroy. his ideals and those of sir
syed with regard to the expansion of the colleges are, the view is the ultimate
development for the formation of a muhammadan university of which the idea was strongly supported
by the late justice mahmood, son of sir syed and by morison, our last principal.
the former indeed dot the former may be indeed to have said, to have formulated,
if not fathered the university scheme while the latter developed it in numerous writings.
now this is the great justice mahmood my lord, as your lordships knows.
the privy council saw his judgments and said, you please become high court judge.
after that, he delivered i think eight significant judgments, and then he resigned, to get
himself involved in this process.
now, my lord, we come to the third phase, which is important.
in nineteen eleven, the muhammadan university foundation committee, now this is important, was constituted for
converting mao college into a muslim university with the raja saab of mahmoodabad as the
president. on the recommendation of government of india dated nineteen eleven, the secretary of state
approved in principle, the establishment of a university at aligarh, subject to provisions of adequate
funds and control.
nineteen eleven again, the government of india specified that a university could be established only
through a bill in the legislative council. over the page my lord. yes. then, my
lord in nineteen eleven, page sixty five or rather pdf sixty five, where an institution
styled as muhammadan oriental college was founded by aligarh in eighteen seventy five under the
leadership of sir syed ahmed khan bahadur with the special object of promoting the diffusion
of western science and literature and are training the character of students by a scheme
adapted to meet the special requirements of the muslim community.
both my lord, a liberal education as well as the demands of the muslim community.
and whereas from the beginning the object of the founder and the muslim community was
to raise such college to the status of a university, whereas a memorial had been
presented to the government by the trustees of the said college and other representatives of
the muslim community praying for the erection of a muslim university and inviting advantages, inviting
attention to the advantages the university would have, which would confer, would confer on their
community to the inadequate representation of which their community had an existing to the enthusiasm
which their own university would create amongst the muslims. and then my lord, and to
the need for religious teaching and protection.
so, the fact as we had pointed out in an interruption, that mao college could
still get degrees, that's not the only point my lord. the point is of substance,
a liberal education, along with the concerns of the muslim community.
then nineteen eleven, the secretary of state says, sanctioning a university at aligarh will be
a source of enlightenment and prosperity of the muslim community and will crown and continue
the hopes of sir syed ahmed khan. the negotiations continued, my lord. and then your
lordships will see, that five lines from the bottom on sixty five, in an intervening
letter dated september tenth nineteen twelve, the education members specifically mentioned that the movement was
started without reference to government and that the hope of sir syed to convert aligarh
into a teaching and residential university, and his hope had been repeatedly expressed since the
leading muhammadans and others are connected with the college.
also note that the draft constitution stated from the beginning the object of the founder
and the muslim community, was to raise the college to the status of a university.
nineteen fifteen my lord, practical shape was given to this and the mao annual report,
i won't read it my lord, and it says the conversion should be there.
then my lord, eight is important on page sixty six.
the muslim community raised thirty lakhs for the university as required by the government. so,
this is the interaction, the money was raised by the muslim community, and this my
lord, you find reference in the statute and in section seven.
now after extended negotiations, the muslim university bill was prepared in nineteen ninety, referred to
the select committee. the select committee submitted its report to february ninth nineteen at the
second of september, the muslim community's predominant role in the university administration is clear from
the debates.
in reference to the constitution of the court, we have retained the provision that no
person other than muslims shall be members.
we have done this because we understand such a provision is in accordance with the
preponderance of muslim feeling.
then my lord, the matter comes to the legislative council. before putting the question, i
would like to add congratulations to the muslim community on the passage of the bill.
i have come, especially this morning, to preside that i may add good wishes, et
cetera.
then, the university act of nineteen twenty, was a statement of objects and reasons which
i've read to your lordships. it is just not the degree as they said, you
could do it before nineteen twenty, it's a wholesome university with liberal education and the
concerns of muslim theology, et cetera.
now all this, what azeez basha does, it says that in the select committee, there
was some disagreement on this.
that's not how to read a select committee. i pointed that out to your lordships.
now, my lord, i have seven dot eight comma is just important because, your lordship
doesn't look just at the de jure situation.
also, the de facto, and this we have pointed out, that the members of the
first court were muslim. eight to twelve members were muslim. every chancellor to date had
been muslim. thirty four out of thirty seven vice chancellors have been muslim. the vast
majority of the members of the court, executive council, academic council and executive council, have
all been throughout, muslims. now you want to take all that away?
because when appointments were made by the government, they made sure that the appointments conform
to the muslim character.
then my lord, i have already read, because, st. stephens looks at the emblems my
lords. i just want to do seven point nine. when this was argued in allahabad,
siddhartha shankar ray gave three volumes. and the court said, yes, of course, it is
muslim in appearance.
but we are bound by azeez basha. now, the history background is.
architecture of the building, such as a deep green colour, quranic inscription clearly show the
islamic character.
photos were shown to evidence to the division bench.
the emblem of amu contains a quranic verse.
the university has a university mosque.
after the amendment was allowed to establish halls, hostels, special centres, specialized laboratories only within
twenty five kms of the university mosque.
the university employs muezzins. at its inceptions, the mau had departments of study, sunni theology,
islamic studies, persian and urdu, studies for islamic medicine, all that i've read to your
lordships. i don't need to read it further.
now, all these documents are in there.
i don't want to take your lordships through them.
i've just summarized them and to answer the argument sort of raised, it's just degrees.
you could have done it before.
no. you wanted a university, and you wanted a liberal education.
your lordships point it can't be full and complete control.
it can't my lord, especially after the constitution. and administer, my lord, has to be
considered.
now, my lord, i'll read some judgments, including tma pai and mother provincial. this your
lordships will find in volume five (a).
this will answer my lord justice khanna's question to some extent.
pre constitution, post-constitution, the change and the requirements.
now, kerala education bill, i'll be, in five (a).
i'll be very fast my lord. starts at page four, but i'll go straight to
seventy one.
i'm sorry.
i missed out on page sixty.
that is somewhere halfway down.
there is no reason why the benefit of article thirty (one) should be limited only
to educational institutions established after the commencement of the constitution.
the language employed in thirty one is wide enough to cover both pre-constitution and post-constitution
institutions.
then, my lord, sixty one is very important.
this is about fifteen lines from the top.
the sentence beginning, to say that an institution which receives aid, on account of its
being a minority educational institution must not refuse to admit any members of the other
community only on the grounds therein mentioned.
and then to say that as soon as such an institution admits such an outsider,
it will cease to be a minority institution.
it is tantamount to saying that minority institutions will not, as minority institutions, be entitled
to aid.
now comes the important part.
the real import of article twenty nine (ii) and thirty (one) seems to be that
it clearly contemplates a minority institution with a sprinkling of outsiders.
let me pause here and get into it.
my lords that sprinkling now, after saint stephen has gone up to forty percent.
saint stephen's says you can go to that extent.
and of course, my lords, this is modified by tma pai says it may not
be fifty percent.
it will depend on the needs of the institution.
then, by admitting a non-member into the minority institution does not shed its character and
cease to be a minority institution, indeed, the object of the conservation of distinct language,
script, culture of a minority may be better served by propagating the same amongst non-members
of the particular community.
in our opinion, it is not possible to read this condition into article thirty, subclause
one.
then my lords, page sixty two comes the important pronouncement of the words of their
choice.
this is just below halfway.
i will go just halfway down.
the key to the understanding of the true meaning and implication of the article under
consideration are the words dot has your lordship got it?
.
of their choice.
it is said that the dominant word is choice and the content of that article
is as wide as the choice of the particular minority may make it.
the ambit of the rights conferred by article thirty (one) therefore, have to be determined.
it should be referred.
to be determined on dot misprint my lord by article thirty (one) and therefore to
be determined.
therefore to be determined on a consideration of the matter from the point of view
of the educational institution.
now all this somehow, kerala education bill was before basha. the foundation had been laid
here and the analysis of article thirty (one) is missing in azeez basha. it just
goes by established or administered, doesn't look at the question of choice.
now kerala is a seven-judge decision binding on tma pai for the interpretation of thirty.
now my lords, seventy one.
this is halfway down because now, where it begins, we have already observed that article
thirty (one) gives two rights to the minorities to establish and to administer educational institutions
of their choice.
the right to administer cannot obviously include the right to mal-administer.
the minority cannot surely ask for aid or recognition for an educational institution run by
them in unhealthy surroundings without any competent teachers possessing any semblance of qualification and which
does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching, and with teaching matters subversive of
the welfare of the scholars.
it stands to reason that the constitutional right to administer an educational institution of their
choice doesn't necessarily militate against the claim of the state to insist that in order
to get grant, the state may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the
institution to be aided.
learned attorney general conceded that reasonable regulation may certainly be imposed.
so, both aspects my lords, excellence.
these are not ghettos.
excellence and application of the general law. then, if your lordships will come to seventy
two.
it says at the top of seventy two, what the state says, i have money
and i shall distribute it, but i shall not give you any of the unless
you surrender to me your right to administration.
then the state must not grant aid in such manner, as will take away the
fundamental right of the minority community under article thirty.
then about one-third from the bottom, no educational institution can, in actual practice, be carried
out without aid from the state and if they will not get it unless they
surrender their, if they will not get unless they surrender their rights, they will by
compulsion of financial necessity, they will be,.they will be compelled to give up their rights.
so, my lords, this whole question of recognition, aid, you don't surrender rights.
seventy six, my lords. this comes to the question of recognition, my lords. azeez basha
says, look, it's a section six.
they're saying recognition that's by the state. now my lord, about just half, last one-third.
then, about, just below halfway, without recognition, azeez basha says you got recognition from the
state, therefore you surrendered your rights.
in a sense, it's implying that, without recognition, therefore, the educational minorities established or to
be established by the minority communities cannot fulfil the real objects of their choice, and
the rights under article thirty, cannot be effectively exercised.
the right to establish national educational institutions of their choice must mean the right to
education, to its right to establish real institutions, which will effectively serve the needs of
their community and the scholars who resort to their institution.
there is no doubt that there is no such thing as a fundamental right to
recognition by the state, but to deny recognition to educational institutions, except upon terms tantamount
to the surrender of their constitutional right of administration and their constitutional.
of their constitutional right of administration.
of the educational institutions of their choice, and in effect, to deprive them of their
rights under article thirty.
so, recognition in the nineteen twenty act, can't be read as something that the government
gave you.
but it is your right.
it can't take it away, and it's quite clear here.
we repeat that the legislative power is subject to fundamental rights, and the legislature indirectly
take away and abridge the rights, which it could not do directly and yet will
be the result of the said bill containing any offending clause becomes law.
now my lords, this is the foundation of the interpretation of article thirty, totally ignored
by azeez basha. this is a seven-judge bench, my lord. there is something in the
kaveri reference, where your lordship said, is it binding on us or is it not,
my lord. i think the wisdom now is that even the reference puts points of
law.
now my lord, ninety four, i come to sidhajbhai. mister dhavan, my question was slightly
different.
my question was.
your lordship's voice is so soft.
okay. now, is it clear?
probably. yes, much better.
yes. okay. my question was slightly different.
it arose from your argument that now, for a university, a statute is required.
now, the establishment, post the independence, after the nineteen fifty six ugc act will be
under a statute.
now, when that is so, will this argument still hold good, what your argument is,
you're raising today?
because, there, it's a legislature there who's creating or enacting the statute.
then will you say the foundation is not by the statute?
yes, there could be cases of colleges, because colleges can be established by minorities.
there's no difficulty on that.
but your argument with regard to university, because it's to be established by the statute,
then what will be the position?
i had indicated to your lordships that, 'establish' cannot be given the narrow meaning, that
it's established by statute.
i indicated that you had to look at origins.
you had to look at nexus.
you had to look at numerical.
this is the criteria.
now, if you take it all into account, the question is, will the ugc act
override article thirty?
no. the fact that there is a requirement of statute will not offend article thirty.
and then, as i indicated, mister dwivedi was amicus in the yashpal order, where he
said, you interpret the ugc act as by and under for every statutory authorities, deemed
universities are covered.
they are under, by or under.
therefore, you cannot have a university, you cannot have a university without degrees, without it
and therefore, my lord, you can't read down, with the ugc act, you can't read
down article thirty.
and then your lordships have seen in the reference in twenty nineteen, the national minority
education act, says you have a right to a minority institution.
so, your lordship's question may lead to an extrusion of tertiary education.
then the question of of their choice comes up.
i don't know if i've fully answered it.
and my lord, the private universities have come up, all under statute.
as long as the statutes permit them, they will fall in.
but now, if this university is set up under the statute, if the statute itself
says it's a minority university.
then obviously, because the funding is done by the, or the establishment is done by
the minority community and minority is a much wider term.
not restricted only to religious minority.
the statute will never say.
that's where the problem will come up.
no, it doesn't come up.
because in saint david ' s, it is certainly true of england, that you have
the right to grant degrees, but you don't have a.
it doesn't come in the royal charter. your lordships will take the statute as it
is and then analyse whether it's a minority institution.
that is antecedent to establish and administer.
if i may say so, that the establishment, if it is correlated to the statutes,
is the wrong way to look at it.
what the statute does is recognize, not establish.
i'm talking about the initial establishment.
establishment is not establishment through an act. my lords, you establish something, it is recognized
by the act. you're saying that statute itself is a recognition of what you have.
yes, it's the recognition.
the establishment happens.
how does it get recognized?
because the statute says, you'll get a degree.
that's the act of recognition.
without that, you won't get a degree.
that's the answer.
establishment of the fact that if the statute does establish or in fact, brings into
being, which is, mother provincial, the fact that it brings into being will not militate
under the minority right under thirty.
we can't whittle down article thirty, just because a statute exists.
and that is a defect in azeez basha, followed by the allahabad high court. now
if i'm right, the learned chief justice does not want me to go into the
allahabad decision which is under appeal before your lordships. that would take a very long
time.
it's a wonderful decision which says that dinner jackets have been exchanged for a sherwani.
great fun to read, chief justice roy. is it saffron or is it green?
that's what he asks.
(he may be confused mostly constitutional act if it is by legislation and university commission
to exist won that being established.
and then we give the parliament to the legislature does not describe it as a
minority, then so be it 's not a minority which the answer is yes, he
comes into existence by rendering of a statute he respects the uds here.
then you have to read the statement.
objects of reasons of that.
particular statute as to why that statute of brought into existence either the community approaches
the government can the community approach the government, like in this case, committee approaches the
government.
government then accepts the representation leaks.
the statute saying it is settled in today.
in today's world, the persons have to approach a particular state concentrate on saddaj vinyl.
i think we did such an statue of integral university which states that there will
be provision for minority and there is integral universities established by muslims and it is
established through legislation article thirty allows you to set up the universal it allows you
to set up universities implement that allow me to do all that we discuss in
the evening you read them better than i do absolute gandhia the right of establishes
fundamental rights is clearly declared in their terms absolute right the only thing is, it's
been watered down national interest now in terms of regulation, not in terms of establishment,
right?
that's the difference and even so, that's not technical because the court says it regulating,
you can have certain restrictions on that, on the regulatory pack, that is the whole
regulation is section balance the question that).arises from your lordship's queries, is thirty, establishment, the
term establishment to be read in a narrow sense, so that it can be taken
away by statute or in a wider sense, to define what a minority institution is.
the subsequent decisions of the court my lord, say read it in the wider sense.
you go back to the history; you try and figure out what the nexus is.
so ultimately, if your lordships are going to give article thirty a narrow meaning by
back to azeez basha. and everything goes my lord. all tertiary education cannot be minority.
at a certain level what happens when a statute takes over an erstwhile institution, whether
it's a school, a college, and gives it a statutory form, this statute really converts
it into a body corporate.
because what was erstwhile maybe just a society, governed by the society's registration act, is
now given the statutory character of a body corporate with a permanent seal and permanent
succession.
does that conversion of a society into a body corporate, so to speak under the
provisions of the act, deprive it of its minority character or is that merely only
a matter of form, to convert the form, which was a society into a body
corporate?
or does that change in form completely destroy the minority character of the institution?
our respectful submission is, it is a mandatory form my lord, that is.
now my lords, this is a fundamental question that your lordship has to resolve.
azeez basha says, universities can be minority institutions.
it also says, they must be done by statute.
and if by statute, they go.
this is the unresolved question, which your lordship has to examine.
and along with something, which says at the end of article thirty, of their choice.
therefore, you have to read establishment as not the be-all and the end-all of article
thirty.
it has to be read as a whole, where it says, of their choice.
and azeez basha says, your choice can be a university.
and both in those days and now, if there is a statute, so, will it
all disappear, my lord?
the entire tertiary education will disappear.
minority institutions.
and therefore, my lord, read the whole of article thirty, which is, i've already said,
the words in kerala university, because the narrow, everything turns on establishment.
that is why mother provincial says it should be to found.
you take all the factors as to what is founded by the minority.
it may not be in the statute.
in the delhi university case, two cases were before the court, the allahabad agricultural university
and st. stephens and you don't find that in the statute necessarily, but you have
to see who founded it.
and your lordship as soon in patro. as soon as you say, christian. they said
it's good enough to found.
so don't., in my respectful submission use established, because, as your lordship puts it, it's
not a matter of form alone.
it's a matter of enabling form.
that enabling has to be there to come under thirty.
then, my lord, we get to the questions of substance and that is the argument
we are advancing.
my lords let me take your lords to page ninety four, sidhajbhai. yes. i'm sorry.
i'm going as fast as i can.
super speed.
now, page one hundred and thirteen.
it's a six-judge bench, just as kerala was a seven-judge bench.
my lord, at end of the first para, kerala education case, therefore, is not an
authority for the proposition submitted by the additional solicitor general that all regulated measures which
are not destructive or annihilating of the character of the institution established by the minority,
provided the regulations are in the national or public interest are valid.
this argument is rejected, but you go to the extreme of saying was it annihilated?
that's the wrong question.
then my lord, the next para.
the right established by article thirty (one) is the fundamental right in terms, absent.
now, my lord, this was tweaked by tma pai to say national interest must come
in.
but as far as azeez basha is concerned, this was binding.
now, i come to the, it is intended to be a real right for the
protection of the minorities in the matter of setting up of an educational institution of
their choice.
the right is intended to be effective and is not to be whittled down by
the so-called regulatory measures conceived in the interest of, not a minority, but of the
public and nation as a whole.
now, this was before the court.
now i come to the next question, which, my lord the chief justice has put,
that what are the implications of the actual substance of these institutions?
the implications are, it must be an institution of excellence and this your lordship will
find on page one hundred and fourteen.
this is the famous dual test, which is adopted by tma pai as well.
such regulation must satisfy a dual test.
the test of reasonableness and the test that it is regulative of the educational character
of the institution and is conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education
for the minority community or other persons who resort to it.
now my lord, i come to mother provincial, which has emphatically been accepted by tma
pai. now, this is on page one hundred sixty three, and the relevant paras which
have been affirmed in tma pai are eight and nine.
i'll take your lordship straight away to that.
page one hundred and sixty six.
this is actually a spy master.
it's spying on what we say to each other.
now, my lord, kindly come to eight, it is very important.
you have to switch off the mic, or tell us to switch off your mic.
we have.
your lordship is right.
now, my lord, kindly come to eight at page sixty six.
article thirty, what it means.
article thirty (one) has been construed by this court without reference to those cases, it
is sufficient to say that the clause contemplates two rights, which are separated in point
of time.
this is important.
the first right is the initial right, to bring into being of an institution.
.bringing into being of an institution.
sorry. the first right is the initial right to establish institutions of the minority choice.
now, when we read article thirty, we don't go straight to establishment.
that's a consequence, it's my right.
we first examine whether it was a minority institution or not.
then, establishment here means, the bringing into being of an institution, and it must be
by the minority community.
the next sentence, important.
it matters not, if a single philanthropic individual, with his own means, founds the institution
if the community at large contributes to the funds.
the position in law is the same and the intention in either case must be
to found an institution for the benefit of the minority, by a member of that
community.
it is equally irrelevant that, in addition to the minority community, other minority.
other minority or even from the majority community can take advantage of the institutions.
such other communities bring in income and they do not have to be turned away.
now come to nine.
this now, i'm dealing with, after the azeez basha, i've dealt with before azeez basha,
sidhajbhai and kerala education. now my lord, nine.
the next part of the right relates to the administration of institutions.
administration means, management of affairs at the institution.
the management must be free of control so that the founders or their nominees can
mould the institution as they think fit and in accordance with their ideas.
i'm sorry, my spectacles are not working.
and this idea of how the interests of the community in general and the institution
in particular will be best served.
no part of this management can be taken away and vested in another body without
an encroachment upon the guaranteed right.
now in para one hundred and nine of tma pai, this is affirmed.
and it's a sea change my lord, from the establishment version in azeez basha. you
first look at, is it a minority institution, then you go further.
now, sorry, now, if your lordships will come to ten, this is where it says
such regulations do not bear directly upon management, as although they may indirectly fail, yet
the right of the state to regulate minority institutions, education, education standards and allied matters
cannot be denied.
the minority institutions cannot be allowed to fall below the standards of excellence expected of
educational institutions or under the guise of the exclusive right of management to decline to
follow the general patterns.
and this applies also to management.
a university doesn't become insular.
that's very important that your lordships have mentioned, and nobody is arguing it should be
insular.
then, i'll take your lordships straight away to st. stephens and then tma pai, and
i'm done with this part.
page three hundred and eighty four.
found, how do we approach it?
it is there in proost to some extent and patro, but i'm coming straight to
st. stephens. now, kindly come to page four.
no, please come to four hundred and thirteen.
para twenty nine.
there's a subheading, 'origins and purpose of saint stephen's college'.
i'm sorry if my reading is somewhat erratic.
i'll try and be more careful.
now, delhi university in this pleading has neither denied nor admitted the minorities of the
college.
then my lord, it says that, they argued that it was done by a foreign
mission from cambridge, and therefore, it was not entitled to the benefit of thirty (one).
four hundred and thirteen, page twenty nine, para twenty nine.
then my lord, it goes through, and i'm not going to read it, because, these
are the factors that you take into account.
the ' eighty one, a christian missionary college came.
members were in residence.
the cambridge brotherhood wanted to establish a christian college.
then all that is mentioned and the condition to the contrary is therefore, not correct.
'the purpose of starting the college'.
this is halfway down of this para.
'could be seen from the report of eighteen seventy eight to cambridge brotherhood', and it
states that the students after leaving saint stephen's mission college joined non-christian colleges and lose
touch with christian teachings.
the case would be otherwise, if we were to send them from our school to
a college where the teachings would be given by christians. that's at, placitum (e).
now come to thirty (one), which is important.
because, these are factors, there are environmental factors but they are important.
and in aligarh, it is writ large that this is an islamic institution.
thirty (one) says, originally the college building was housed in hired premises paid by the
spg. a new building was eventually constructed by the society for the propagation of the
gospel, wherein the foundation stone bore the following inscription, to the glory of god and
the advancement of sound learning and religious education.
the new building was then started in december eighteen eighty one and on the front
of the porch at the top of the parapet, a cross in bas relief was
displayed, and under the brackets, 'ad dei gloriam', which has been inscribed since, and since
adopted by the college.
today, the new college building campus has also a large cross on top of the
main tower and, to perpetuate and remind the students the motive and objective of the
college, the glory of god. this all emanates from found.
the primary right is found.
the consequential rights are establish and administer.
now, thirty four, sums it up.
'it would thus appear that since its foundation in eighteen eighty one, saint stephen's college
has apparently maintained its christian character and would be evident from its very name, emblem,
motto, establishment of a chapel and its religious instructions in the christian chapel for religious
ceremony.
this is the scope of inquiry.
now, my lord, come to four hundred and seventeen, para forty one.
it was contended that saint stephen's college, after being affiliated to the delhi university, had
lost its minority character.
in other words, when you come under statute under the delhi act of nineteen twenty
two, do you lose your character?
so that's the statutory provision.
then it says the argument was based on some provisions of the delhi university act
and the ordinance made there under.
it was said that the students are admitted to the university and not to the
college as such, but we find no substance in this contention.
in the first place, it may be stated that the state or any instrumentality of
the state cannot deprive the character of institution founded by a minority community by compulsory
affiliation.
since article thirty (one) is a special right of minorities to establish educational institutions of
their choice.
the minority institution has a distinct identity and the right to administer with continuance of
this identity cannot be denied by coercive action.
any such coercive action would be void, being contrary to the constitutional guarantee.
the right to administer is the right to conduct and manage the affairs of the
institution.
this right is exercised by a body of person in whom the founders have faith
and confidence.
such a management body cannot be displaced or reorganized if the right to be recognized,
is to be recognized and maintained.
so, recognition doesn't stand a, reasonable restrictions are permissible, but regulations should be of a
regulatory character and not abridge the right under thirty (one).
so, here we see the intervention of statute.
as a constituent college, it was by/under the act of nineteen twenty two.
then, my lord, if i may come to page four hundred and twenty two?
para fifty four.
i'm sorry.
i didn't realize, your lordship was conferring.
the minorities, whether based on religion or language have the right to establish and administer
educational institutions of their choice.
the administration of educational institutions of their choice under article thirty means management of the
affairs of the institution.
this management must be free from control so that the founders and other nominees can
mould the institution as they think fit and in accordance with their ideas how the
interests of the rest of the community and the institution in particular will be served.
then my lord, i would like to come.
sorry, the next line.
i'm sorry.
the standards of education are not a part of management as such.
the standard concerns of the body politic is governed by considerations of the advancement of
the country and its people.
such regulations that do not bear directly on the management or they may indirectly affect
it.
the state, therefore has a right to regulate the standard of education and allied matters.
minority institutions cannot be permitted to fall below the standards of excellence expected of educational
institutions.
now, they cite the cases, which i needn't cite, because they say this is now
confirmed by a string of decisions.
this is in line with both the decision of justice hidayatullah and mother provincial and
the judgment of justice jagannath shetty in saint stephen ' s.
they don't refer to dot they don't cite the judgment in basha, they refer to
all the other, because perhaps basha in that sense is a little out of alignment
with what was laid down in the other decisions.
as you will see that justice hidayatullah, that passage you read out and actually, para
fifty four is a restatement of justice hidayatullah said in para nine and ten.
absolutely. but justice hidayatullah refers to all the earlier cases, but doesn't refer to basha.
my lords basha is referred to in saint stephen's but it doesn't do anything.
stephen's refers to sidhajbhai, bombay education. at para twenty four page.
basha is on a fact situation.
yes. i think my learned friend is arguing his case already.
now my lords basha dot now my lords kindly just turned to four hundred and
ten.
.
on page four hundred and ten.
it mentions it in para twenty four.
and para twenty five says it's been superseded by patro. my lord para twenty four
on page four hundred and ten.
i won't read all of it because this we've done.
then, my lord, twenty five.
a couple of years after azeez basha, this court had another occasion to determine the
nature of an ancient institution claiming to be minority.
the decision, as per reported in s k patro since it appears to be in
close parallel with the case at hand, it would be useful to drive the contentions.
then my lord, the contentions are there.
and then what happened, in para twenty seven.
on appeal the judgment of the high court was reversed by this court mainly on
two grounds, that's at page four hundred and eleven.
the high court did not pay sufficient attention to that part of the evidence supplied
by the petitioners, which was sufficient to justify the claim that local citizens had participated
in the establishment and the school in question.
indian citizenship not being a condition of the application of article thirty, the protection there
under could not be denied on this basis.
so, my lord, here we have a clear statement that if you take patro into
account, you have to look at the evidence and this court reversed it on that
basis.
now, back to.
may i continue?
yes. page four hundred and twenty four.
the bottom of the page, para fifty nine.
lays the foundation for tma pai. the need for a detailed study on this aspect
is not necessary.
the right of minorities, whether religious or linguistic, to administer educational institutions and the power
of the state to regulate academic matters and the management is now fairly settled.
so, that regulation to bring it up to an excellent institution, is there, the right
to administer does not include the right to mal-administer.
the state being the controlling authority has the right to regulate all academic matters.
regulations which will serve the interest of students and teachers and to preserve the uniformity
in standards of education among the affiliated institutions could be made.
the minority institution cannot claim immunity against the general pattern or standards or general laws,
such as the laws relating to law and order, health, hygiene, labour relations, social welfare,
contract, tort, which are applicable to all communities.
so long as the basic right to management is not taken away, the state is
competent to make regulatory legislation.
regulations shall not have the effect of depriving the right of minorities, to educate their
children in their own institution.
that is a privilege which is implied by the right conferred in article thirty. four
hundred and thirty three.
now four hundred and thirty three, para eighty.
.
that you're not admitting only students from your.
and those others who resort to it.
others who resort to it.
that's the important part my lord, kerala. and now here.
otherwise, what will happen, it will become a communal institution, we don't want that.
it's a kind of protection, and i've said in saint xavier ' s, it is
needed there, to avoid discrimination against the minorities.
i won't go through, saint xavier ' s.
it's a very long decision.
now, kindly come to eighty.
broadly speaking, eighty says reiterates kerala education bill and therefore, now come to eighty eight.
i have just two more quotations from saint stephen ' s, which i feel that
your lordship will indulge me.
we are nearly at four o'clock.
i will read and do tma pai tomorrow.
yes. now my lords, eighty eight, since the receipts of a state at four hundred
and thirty five does not impair the rights of article thirty (one), the state can
lay down reasonable conditions for obtaining grant and aid for its proper utilization.
the state has no power to compel minority institutions to give up their rights under
article thirty.
and then my lords sidhajbai. then the regulation cannot change the character of the institution.
such regulations must satisfy that dual test my lords, of reasonableness and excellence, reiterated here
again.
now, kindly come to page four hundred and thirty nine.
at the bottom of the page, para one hundred and two.
lord, may i just read it?
yes. your time controllers are here, my lord. 'in the light of all these principles
and factors, and in view of the importance the constitution attaches to protective measures to
minorities under article thirty (one), the minority aided institutions are entitled to prefer their community
candidates, to maintain the minority character of the institution, subject, of course, to conformity with
the university standards.
the state may regulate the intake.
in this category and due regard to the need of the community in the area
which the institution is intended to serve.
but in no case shall an institution exceed fifty percent.
the minority institution shall make available at least fifty percent '.
now my lord, from trickling, we have now recognized fifty percent.
of course, tma pai says, it's in the nature of the institution.
just read the last but one sentence, once again.
sorry, my lord?
just read that last but one sentence, paragraph one hundred and two.
the state.
'the minority institution shall make available', that one?
yes. at least fifty percent of the annual admissions to members of communities other than
the minority community, the admission of such minority candidates shall be done perfectly on the
basis of merit.
of course, in saint stephen's they said, you can do an interview, which was crucial.
delhi university said, you can't do an interview.
and although it was a.
so, please don't comment upon it.
so, my lords, i will stop here, if i may, and thank your lordships for
your gracious acceptance of my taking the chair.
we'll re-assemble tomorrow morning.
