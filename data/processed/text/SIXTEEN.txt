let's not open the matter. just give us this, that's all.
listen, we are in a combination of 7 don't...
on that day we will put it.
the order of this matter we've placed before your lordships.
yes. the advocate general will argue first.
then mr. shadan farasat, then mr. sibal, mr. venugopal, mr. nilesh gupta, mr. gopal sankaranarayanan, seshadri, rakesh khanna, salman khurshid, shraddha deshmukh, shivam singh, vivek sharma.
the time, which, of course, everybody has reserved for themselves, we'll have to substantially cut down, because after the first few lawyers have argued, i think the matter will be clear then, both sides.
yes. may i please, my lords. in my humble submission, my lord, there are two core issues that eventually will steer the arguments in this matter.
the first, of course, being my lord, that as regards reservation, what is the efficacy of the measures taken by the government to eradicate inequality in the 76 years of independence wherein the constitutional provisions have been in play as regarding reservation.
and the second core issue would be...
mr. solicitor, on your side, it will be the attorney and you, right?
yes, we are not on this side.
right. absolutely. in absence of the space, we are sitting on this side.
there is some kind of a merger of thoughts, so...
in fact, i noticed that at the time when the matter was referred, attorney was appearing then for the state of tamil nadu.
so, the submissions are recorded by justice misra's referring order.
in fact i appeared for the private party, but the court has generously said i have appeared to the state of tamil nadu.
doesn't make a difference at all. the stand is the same.
stand is the same. who will be taking a contrary viewpoint?
i am appearing for state of tamil nadu.
right. so my turn will be after mr. sibal or...?
we are not aware of that sequencing.
but whenever... it's your lordships call. we'll take a call.
after the parties in the main matter have argued, then we can hear whoever is supporting on the side.
that is, after that your lordships will hear the other side and...
so my lords are trying to determine, is there another side or not.
i'll be arguing for chinnaiah. supporting.. you are supporting chinnaiah.
that's good. mr. ganesh, are you supporting chinnaiah also?.
i'm supporting the state of haryana, i'm in the haryana appeal which is effectively the lead appeal because that was the earlier referral that's all right.
therefore, you are saying that chinnaiah should be reconsidered.
it should be revisited. so apart from your learned friend, who else?
i am just saying that it should not be reconsidered.
so, at least we have some contest then.
that's very important because we must have two perspectives.
tamil nadu also.. that's all right. we are on who says chinnaiah need not be reconsidered, because we must have some contest and somebody from the other side.
we are supporting chinnaiah. all right, so that's good.
we have therefore, we have counsel on both sides.
tamil nadu, he wants... he is actually appearing in the writ petition.
he is not appearing in the... because i think the list wrongly mentions that he's appearing in the intervention.
as every counsel gets up, we'll ask them which matter they're appearing in, so that we have that clearly defined.
your lordship, the parties and then interveners so that we can...
so first, the parties and then the interveners.
i think that'd be correct. so, that we can adjust our...
yes mr.... tamil nadu also wants chinnaiah to be revisited.
yes, of course. we have seen the referring judgment, so we know that.
yes, mr. advocate general. to start again...
the first core issue, my lord, which your lordships would examine, is the efficacy of measures taken under the constitutional provisions framed for eradication of inequality, in over 76 years of our independence and the second issue...
the efficacy of measures adopted... ... by the states for eradication of inequality in over 76 years of independence.
that's the first. and the second is the interplay of the constitutional provisions regarding the powers in the federal structure of our country, interplay of the constitutional provisions regarding the powers in the federal structure for identification and implementation of the measures so taken.
i can repeat it, my lord. the interplay of constitutional provisions regarding powers in the federal structure for identification and implementation of the measures so taken.
but before we go into this my lord, what is very necessary to understand is, very briefly the concept of reservation.
it obviously has two perspectives which are very strongly entrenched in our social and legal fraternities.
the first perspective of course is of those who believe they are entitled and the second perspective which most certainly needs the attention of this honourable bench is of those who are actually in need.
my lord, before i go any further, we have to understand that reservation is no benevolence.
it is not an act of benevolence by the entitled to the needy at all.
if at all, it is compensation for centuries of suppression of the needy, if at all.
and my lord, nothing would correct itself on its own, so therefore, the established requirement is that of an affirmative action, what we are addressing your lordships on today.
the only way to provide support to the needy is the affirmative action on which we will be addressing your lordships.
why this has come about to be is not far to see, especially in our country where the caste system has prevailed for centuries, we are all aware, and there has always been a deep divide and the ramifications of that have resulted in certain castes being marginalised to a status of despair and almost of non-existence in the social fabric of our society.
what has come to those who have been marginalised in the generic sense of the word, we can call backwardness, because that word will occur repeatedly as we address your lordships and refer to the judgments.
in a generic sense, that word is backwardness as opposed to what we never talk about and take it for granted for the people who have it is, forwardness.
forwardness is taken as an entitlement by those who have it.
but what we need to really look at is the backwardness.
and the backwardness my lord in my humble submission, can be faceted in many ways.
it being social backwardness or economic backwardness or educational backwardness, so on and so forth, my lord.
we can have a debate on this alone, that for those who suffer, what is the kind of ignominy and backwardness that they are victims of, but the issue, my lord is the cure.
we've been striving to find this cure through a series of judgments, through a series of legislations, through a series of executive decisions, but obviously, my lord, because we stand before your lordships to address again on this issue, means that much needs to be done and what has been done is most certainly not enough.
if we were to put it very simply.
though not a panacea for this ill of society, a cure definitely is equality.
the only thing by which these lines can be blurred, and we have a society that the constitution envisages, the cure is eventual equality.
now to achieve this, we must understand, however overrated the issue of reservation is, but reservation is only a tool.
reservation is only a means to achieve the end of the sacrosanct ideal which is equality.
now, as in everything else, a tool is of no consequence till in the hands of a good sculptor.
merely providing for reservation is not the answer.
a tool has to be used for the purpose that it has been designed to achieve the result that we seek to so desperately achieve for our country, which is equality.
and this implementation can be done most certainly through law, definitely through the executive action of the state and also through social debate and the constitutional framers had this intent very clear in their mind, while providing for reservation, that the only reason which weighed with them was the realization of the disparity that existed, the disparity that was hard to ignore, the disparity which was in the face of the country when we became independent, and the effort was to achieve bharat, india, where eventually everyone has a right to equality.
so, my lord, article 14 is what we strive to achieve, and everything else thereafter in part 3 or the parts thereafter, has been designed to achieve that end, is equality of opportunity.
it is not a case where we are before your lordships to say, that somebody who has not played could definitely not have won.
that's not the case here. the case here is, did he have a chance to play?
did he have the opportunity to play?
did he have the means to play?
and did he even have the path to the ground where the game was played?
the answer is no. when the privileged played the game and the top amongst them win, we failed to think about those who couldn't even make it to the playground because of the inadequacy of the means that they do not possess.
so therefore, my lord, i'll read the preamble, but what comes out of it is, that equality of status and opportunity is the hallmark of our constitution and the assurance that we propose to give it is an assurance of dignity because no opportunity or status without dignity is complete.
you cannot give opportunity as charity because, charity takes away the dignity.
there have to be provisions enacted and implemented in law to achieve this equality of status and opportunity with dignity, and this is what can effectively eradicate what we call backwardness.
my lord, there is a reason why, as i said, after 75 years of independence, we are still struggling to achieve this goal.
it's easier written, than implemented. the words have been there, the intent has been there, the implementation has been there, but there is not much achievement to show for it because what has been precipitated by centuries of suppression was not expected to go away in a decade.
it wasn't. as some people might say, ten years was the limit set for reservation to achieve what centuries had caused.
can't be done. we are very well aware of it, my lord, but let us not marginalize the efforts that we've made, but most certainly we are not there as yet, and this matter, my lord, is yet another effort to convince your lordships to lay down a law which will eventually help the benefits of reservation to percolate down to the strata who need it the most.
the reason is my lord, that a class of people belonging to varied castes...
these are two different concepts my lord, as we go along, we'll obviously dwell on them that caste and class are totally two different concepts.
a lot many number of castes in india my lord, are stuck, unfortunately in a self-deprecating cycle of occupational drudgery.
even today, there is one thing in inheritance which a lot of castes get, which is their occupation.
scavengers, sweepers, cobblers, blacksmiths... what they've handed down in inheritance, legacy and estate to their next generation is an occupation which will never allow them to come out till aided by what we call affirmative action.
the reason is that there is a condition.
we are all as human beings victims of conditioning.
we are conditioned to believe that everything is all right.
we are conditioned to believe that things are the way they are because they are meant to be.
oft heard dialogue is my lord, if these people were not to do this job, who else will?
and that is the reason these things should remain as it is but that definitely is a mindset we need to shake ourselves out of.
there are no ironclad barriers, which should keep the backward confined to their backwardness just because what they do is what nobody else would do and they're not doing what they are doing will not suit the entitled.
that is the answer. we have to change these prejudices, we have to change the mindset.
the problem is the resistance. the problem is the resistance to change that mindset.
the problem is that it seems like a huge shift in a societal mindset to steer ourselves away from it and think that why can everybody in the society not be equal.
and as we go along, my lord, the core issue here is not only the advantaged and the disadvantaged but the more advantaged and the more disadvantaged within the disadvantaged.
that is the issue that we are addressing your lordships.
undoubtedly, my lord, the change has to come at the grassroot level of society.
undoubtedly. what happens in the mind is controlled by exposure mostly to what is taught in each and every household of this country.
that has to change. but it still does not take away the obligations upon the state to aid and assist this change which either in the form of bringing about a law by the legislature, decisions of the executive and more important than anything else, the laying down of the law by your lordships, which will eventually bring this change.
because once your lordships lay down a law, the acceptance of a proposition goes up tremendously, because your lordship says so there is a dispensation of the public to follow the law.
so from either of these three wings, if an assistance and aid is coming in achieving these results, it is more important than the other.
we cannot downplay any part of this.
because as i put it my lord, normally when we argue cases of reservation, a very common plea is raised that my lord i have 99% marks.
i am being ousted by a person who has 56% marks.
is that fair? yes, it is. it is fair because the person who has 56%, he never had the means to be brought up in a family that you've come up in.
he never had the means to go to a school that you went to, to the college that you went to and to the competition, preparation that you went through and today 99 is not your achievement.
it is a conglomeration of all the factors that you've been through.
that 56 is in spite of the factors that that child has been through.
he has today reached 56 starting from zero.
your ride has been of an airplane from your birth.
this person has walked his way to 56.
that is what we need to understand.
that the person who got 56 had no access to a dignified life, he was brought up in a neighbourhood which did not give him any access to good education, what to talk of employment and eventually, my lord, what are we striking to achieve here?
by way of employment, we are wanting to make that person a part of governance.
he has to feel that, 'i am a part of running this country. i am a part of aiding the growth of this country by getting employment'.
that is why we mostly be, my lord, on 16(4).
so for that purpose, the obligation of the state is best discharged by affirmative action under 15(4) and 16(4), to give this person, who is backward, access.
we have to give him at least an opportunity.
i will go as far as to say that, the old phrase, that you can take a horse to water, you can't make him drink.
we will have to make an effort to make that horse drink, because that horse has never seen water.
that horse does not know that, it is this water which would eventually quench his thirst for becoming a part of governance.
he wants it, but he doesn't know how to get it because he's stuck in a cycle of occupational drudgery, which the society doesn't let him come out.
though opportunities are available, but they are not being capitalized because of...
i would not say the intent but the effectiveness of the implementation is lacking.
my lord, eventually if we all agree on this, that the goal is equality of opportunity, then what we urge before your lordships today, is that measures need to be taken to make this goal not illusionary or formal, not a mere provision on paper.
these goals do not have to be illusionary or formal, but actual and effective.
they have to be end oriented. if i can put it simply, they have to be end oriented.
results have to show. and in this there is a heavy onus upon the state, either at the centre or the state level, for achieving this equality of opportunity.
this implementation has happened in phased manners.
there have been amendments in the constitution, there have been large number of executive orders, memorandums, laws, legislations brought out by various states, one of them of my state is under challenge before your lordships, from where this litigation arose.
just to put it briefly, though it's not a relevant issue that your lordships would be deciding.
in punjab, we brought out an act in 2006, where out of the posts which were reserved for the scheduled castes, 50% of the posts were reserved for balmikis and mazhabis.
that is your first circular, which you brought out?
this was circular apart, this was the legislative act which was under challenge.
the circular preceded the  because the circular had been struck down basically for want of legislative sanctions.
yes. so therefore, the legislation in 2006 and section 4(5) reserved 50% of the posts for balmiki sikhs and mazhabis and my lord, there is a twofold implementation which saves it from the vice of discrimination and reverse reservation and reverse discrimination as we know it.
this reservation in the 2006 act, was done on a twofold check and balance.
one, that this reservation was limited to 50%, which in the development of law, my lord, has become the lakshman rekha which we are all advised not to cross and the second check in balance was that this was implemented on a preferential basis.
so, my lord, as i would say, this was not an act of exclusion by any standard, by any standard.
what chinnaiah, seeks to say is that, this would be an act of exclusion.
no. this was, if at all, an act of inclusion of those who were the most backward of the backward to bring them if not at par, at least up from where they stood.
mr. attorney general, when you said that it was implemented on a preferential basis...
that's right can you elaborate that? how is it implemented on a preferential basis?
my lord, suppose there are ten vacancies for scheduled castes in a particular year or a particular recruitment.
five were reserved for balmikis and mazhabis, if they were available, and if they were not available, it was to go to sc others, which are ramdasias and other scheduled castes, which were available.
so in every recruitment, one would ensure that ten scheduled castes definitely came in, but at the first instance, the right of preference of five of those ten was to go to balmikis and mazhabis.
there's no carry forward for...? carry forward was, my lord...
for the sc together? yes. but not for the balmikis and mazhabis seats within the sc.
no, they were exhausted within that recruitment.
so therefore, if i can put it my lord in cost effective way, this preference based reservation was not at anybody's cost.
it was not that if they did not get it, nobody would get it.
if they did not reach the my lord cut off for getting that reservation, a scheduled caste only, would get it.
and your lordships are right. those scheduled caste vacancies were to be then, in common law my lord, as we all know it, to be carried forward and not counted towards reservation, this, that and the other.
all those parameters were to follow. it was not that they would either be converted to general or not be filled up and left vacant.
there's nothing of that sort. so therefore, that is the core my lord, that if you cannot even as much as give preference to somebody who's really needy, without that being at the cost of somebody, and that act of the state government is squashed, is that correct?
we are here to urge that before your lordships.
actually, mr. attorney general, there is an element of exclusion.
i mean, let's not gloss over it.
the point only is this that because the same exclusion which applies to reservation per se...
per se of excluding merit, as we all put it.
post are reserved for the backward community, a) there is necessarily an exclusion of the forward community in competing for those posts.
right? yet our constitutional jurisprudence permits it.
why? because we treat as, we treat equality as a substantive equality, not formal equality.
that's right. therefore, post n.m thomas, we have now developed jurisprudence to the effect that, reservation is not really a breach of equality, but in aid of equality.
but the same. interestingly, the same argument which applies for reservation for the backward communities is the block, the backward versus forward would also apply within the backward community.
because what now we are really doing here by the measure which the punjab legislature brought about was this, that within the reservation of seats for the scheduled castes, its 15.5%.
we'll take it for a moment. just as a benchmark.
that's right. as a ballpark figure. out of the 15.5% which falls within the overall 50% cap, 50% of the 15.5% is reserved for the mazhabi sikhs and the balmikis.
that's right. so, to that extent to which the reservation is exclusively carved out for them, the other backward castes cannot compete for those posts which are set apart from this.
so in a sense... in the first instance, they can't.
in a sense, it is in that sense, exclusionary.
we can't gloss over the point that it is exclusionary.
we can't. the only question, really, is this, that can that exclusion not be justified on the same yardstick, that we have applied for the exclusion in the backward versus forward context.
my lord if i had to put it very...
because within the backward within the backward communities, within the scheduled caste, is there anything in constitution jurisprudence which restrains the state from saying that, i am not deleting a community from the list of scheduled caste which has been designated by the president and article 341 or 342.
but within those communities, i am now making a classification that certain communities are more backward and therefore, in greater need for protection on the same touch stone of substantive equality.
and if that can be done by the state in reserving, in carving out certain posts out of the competition of the general community, then why can't the state do it within the backward communities?
that's really the... absolutely. but there is an element of exclusion.
we must face it there. i don't think we can gloss over it.
what this entire example that your lordship have given in is based upon a very simple word which is, relative backwardness.
once we concede to the argument of relativity and backwardness, and it is the backwardness vis-a-vis the forward which brings them into the 50% and it is the further more backwardness within the 50%, which gives them the reservation within the reserved, then this argument has no problem.
now chinnaiah, said... chinnaiah's whole rationale was this, that the power to designate communities as scheduled caste and scheduled tribes exclusively belongs to the president, and now, therefore, parliament.
absolutely. for instance you know in milan we have got all those palghat jillla thandan and milan chatvari which came from maharashtra.
that's true. it is not open, for instance, for the court to say, that though this community is designated as a scheduled caste, another community is part of the designated community.
you have to take the list, that you can't do, that jurisprudence is now very, very well set.
you can't think away the list. that power has been reserved, that power has been reserved for the parliament remains so.
but the argument that seems to have found favour in chinnaiah was this, that if that is so, then the state cannot classify within the list of communities which are designated as scheduled caste, because to make that classification would amount to an exclusion of some communities within the scheduled caste that seems to be the logic of...
yes and no. i mean, very simply.
that's really the heart of the controversy.
because, chinnaiah in my humble submission was a plane which took off from the wrong runway.
and your argument would be, i guess that you are not deleting any community from the list which has been designated by the parliament.
there's no exclusion. there's no exclusion, but within the quota, within the quota, you're saying...
why should there not be exclusion? according to you, amongst a particular category, some of these sub-castes have done better, they are the forward in that category.
absolutely. so they should come out of that and compete with the general, why stay there?
let the remaining who are still backward within the backward, let them have the reservation.
my lords are absolutely right. but there are two ways that this whole concept...
once they achieve the concept of reservation, they should move out of that category.
that is the aim. yes. and if the aim is achieved, then the purpose for which the exercise was taken should come to an end.
because nobody my lord... aim is achieved according to you for certain sub-castes, in that particular community.
within, within my lord. that's what i'm saying it works in two ways.
they have achieved, they should come out and the remaining should get that benefit.
yes, now my lord, your lordships are suggesting...
your argument appears to be, among the backward there are more backward and therefore, they require a more special treatment than the backwards.
yes, yes. my lord what justice nath is suggesting is the ultimate.
your argument also would be at two levels.
one is the equality argument and the other is a federal argument, which you also made.
one, the equality argument postulates that it is open to the state to classify within the scheduled caste, by identifying those who are really, really within them in a state of relative marginalisation.
absolutely. that's the substantive equality argument. and if you can do that between the general communities and the backward castes, why can you not apply the same principle there?
same principle there. the second, of course, is the federal argument, that every state within the nation, is peculiarly conversant with the conditions of the caste and communities which are prevalent in that state.
so right. and therefore, what parliament is done, is to designate castes and tribes for the entirety of the nation.
but that does not take away the power of every state within its own territories to say that, well, these are the communities within my state, who are particularly marginalized, who are worthy of special attention..
benefits, as they call. benefits. and there is nothing in the constitutional structure to prevent the state from doing it, because it ultimately owes responsibility to its own decision.
absolutely. my lord now, what justice nath saying is the ultimate argument, which they rightly note, is for the parliament.
you must have done some exercise, in identifying...
yes, in identifying the backward within the backward the backward within the backward, the mazhabis and the balmikis.
absolutely. what are the parameters or the considerations you have taken in identifying?
various reports, which show that those people are two things.
one, they continue to be backward, and or, in spite of being what they are, they are not adequately represented in services under the state.
these are two parameters. one, are they really the backward within the backward?
two, whether they are backward within the backward or not so backward, or forward backward or backward forward, they are still not represented.
so there is something lacking somewhere in the matter of policy, and that is what the state seeks to address.
now, mr. advocate general, do we have some population data on what is the total population of scs in punjab, and what is the population of the balmikis and mazhabi sikhs within that group of scs?
what is the population available? we do, my lord.
we do. they are all statistically available.
but why i am not stressing upon that, is because the reference to your lordships primarily...
it's not a numerical argument, but.. not a numerical argument.
the argument is, first of all, can you do it, as justice nath has correctly put, can you do it?
if you can, and the answer is yes, who is to do it?
parliament, state, executive, legislative. and if who is to do it is determined, then how that state has to do it?
how is not the issue before for your lordships.
now, you have sort of laid down the jurisprudential framework in the first part of your submission.
now, why don't we go into the nitty-gritty of it?
first, the statutory provision. i will come to that in two minutes.
and then, we'll look at chinnaiah and why we look at the law before chinnaiah and after chinnaiah, chinnaiah 2005.
chinnaiah has then been overtaken by a lot of law on the subject.
now my lord, why i'm trying to distinguish that argument is, that chinnaiah proceeds on the basic premise that, exercise of power for the purposes of identifying the backward within the backward, is only of the parliament in any exercise by the state to that effect tinkers with that power.
what chinnaiah has possibly failed, we'll go through the judgment and see if i'm correct is that, 16(4) is an independent provision which has to be exercised by the state, either centre or the state government.
the powers which give the enabling provision, an exercise to be conducted by forming an opinion, is totally within the legislative domain and the executive domain of the state government.
there, parliament does not figure. so the distinction is, for instance, that there is a room in which benefits are being provided.
in common parlance 341 and 342, are the pass with which you get into the room, that's all.
are you entitled to be in the room or not, the president decides.
first list, which is a one-time exercise by the president, that whether you're entitled to be in the room or not.
then as common culture goes, we have vip passes.
so then the parliament decides, that whether who's in the room is entitled to be in the room or to be displaced from the room or whose outside can be given an entry into the room or not.
there are two different exercises. one, is a one-time exercise by the president.
he issues an order in 1950 for punjab, let's say that these 26 castes are entitled to be in the room for the purpose of benefits which the scheduled castes are entitled.
understood. thereafter, that power is taken away from the president and vests, totally in the parliament that whether those inside, as your lordship put it, are entitled to remain inside any longer or not, and whether those outside have reached a stage where they now become entitled to be insightful.
so what is very interesting is that even the constitution in 341 and 342 accepts this exercise to be a two way street.
the power of the president is a one way street.
once you issue an order in common words, you become functus officio.
you cannot touch that order on the executive side anymore.
once that exercise has been done, then forever the parliament will remain vested with the power to legislate.
to include more communities or exclude. to include more communities or to exclude.
so my lords were right. that power to that exclude.
you attained. you attained that forwardness, which does not any more entitle you to be called as a backward class.
you have to exit the room and make place for other people, as your lordships have put it.
taking further, the concern expressed on my learned brother, justice vikram nath, if within a particular backward class...
please my lord. ... certain castes have reached that position and they are on par...
please my lord. ... as he pointed out then, then they should move out.
they should exit and make... but then that is again for the parliament to...
only for the parliament. only. now since we are deciding an important issue...
please my lord. ... just give me a thought for consideration of all issues.
absolutely. right. what happens person from scheduled caste and tribe gets into ias, ips.
that's right. so once you are ips, ias, ifs, his children don't suffer the disadvantages that the persons from the category were residing in the village were.
my lords are right. but then by virtue of reservation, they are also entitled to get in the second generation and again in third generation.
. beg your pardon. is not available for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe.
now it is. after jarnail . now it is.
but that's again, my lord yes, so that is not the area i am immediately coming to, but just to take the example forward of what my lord justice gavai has pointed out.
who enters or exits the room. let's put it as a two way street.
who enters or exits the room is the prerogative of the president, followed by the parliament forever.
but. you are saying the distribution... the distribution of the sweets and the benefits inside the room...
those who are already within the room is for the state...
my lord, to say that those who are underweight will be given a free meal.
let us take it. anybody under 50 kgs of weight is entitled to be in the room for those benefits.
very well understood. a person is 49.
he's still in that room. there's a person who's 27 kgs, who needs it far more.
are you going to treat both of them equally?
let me test the argument to its logical end.
please. my lord. test the argument. can the state say that we are giving 100% reservation out of the scheduled castes only to these two communities?
no, my lord. cannot be and should not be.
why? why? because then you are excluding.
without legislating, you have virtually done what only 341 can do.
you have a problem there, because even if you are making it short of a 100%, exclusion is implicit, so you can't place it on the exclusionary argument.
100% is an absolute exclusion, but 50% is an exclusion qua for those who can't compete for that 50% within the backward community for that right.
my lords are right. there is an element of exclusion, so we'll have to answer it, if you have to in saying that chinnaiah was perhaps...
chinnaiah was overlooked by our jurisprudence, that we can't place it on this that look, i am not excluding.
we'll have to place it in a more sound jurisprudential foundation.
whether it's preferential treatment... what he is argued is that they have applied the principle of 50%, which is considered as laxman rekha for...
because in institutional preference... there is no complete exclusion.
no complete exclusion. institutional preference in medical colleges.
even otherwise by providing 50% reservation for backward classes, to exclude 50% for general category.
and that your lordships have upheld. indra sawhney which, of course, went into this issue in detail said that otherwise you will be inhibited in taking up any exercise qua reservation....
because if you say that you cannot do it because it amounts to exclusion, it will not be the intent of the constitution.
if you have to do it, whether you can place checks and balances on it, is the intent of the constitution.
and that 50% is, of course, my lord a judge made law.
where your lordships have held. let's be fair.
could i go one step further? is the state bound by the 50% cap while applying the distribution of benefits within the 50%?
why should we? i mean why should we?
i mean otherwise it's very attractive but is the state truly bound by the 50% cap?
within the backward? can the states not say, look, in my state, my state, these communities are, these are the truly marginalised communities.
i want the benefits to go to them.
yes. i'm not breaching the cap insofar as the general communities are concerned.
i'm not ousting equality of opportunity for them.
my lords are right. but within my state, these are not...
okay these are 2 here, maharashtra may say or tamil nadu may say no, it's not 2, it's 7 in my state, it may say it's 15.
can the state do that? can they not do it?
why can't they do it? i'll try and answer it my lord.
but when we talk about provision of reservation, let's be very clear that there is no mandate by law, there is no mandate by law to provide reservation.
therefore, 15 and 16 are enabling provisions when we talk of law going to court.
with reference to indra sawhney my lord, i disagree with that no, no, we are developing an argument.
to provide for reservation my lord, what has broadly been laid out.
it's kind of an enabling provisions. yes, there are four checks and balances.
though indra sawhney says that even if sub-article 4 of 16 was not there, still, the state would have been empowered to make reservation, because...
article 16 (1) ... article 46 emphatically states what is implicit in 16.
that's article 46 and the consequences. that you will take care of them, that is your obligation.
how you will do it? my lord then there are powers to be exercised.
but there are four checks and balances.
my lord. i can share them at the outset with your lordships, which eventually...
why don't we do this? why don't we now look at the judgments?
and see what is the area for area, for manoeuvrability that, what is now...
? i will just answer that question in short.
so what your lordships have determined, my lord.
one is backwardness, which i've submitted before your lordships as relative.
backwardness in the case of obcs has been held to be a determinative factor, that whether you are backward or not, the state will decide.
in the case of scheduled castes, your lordships have held, backwardness is presumed.
you cannot go into the exercise of determining the backwardness if you're a scheduled caste.
the second factor, my lord, is inadequacy in representation in public services.
now this is a database concept. just answering my lord, my lord justice chandrachud's question.
this is a database concept, it's statistics.
are you adequately represented or not? though my lord, that word may have a lot of connotations because they do not say, 'equally represented', though we've never gone into that.
they do not say equally represented. it can't be that they can ever be brought at a common platform.
maybe, maybe not. the word used is adequately represented, and that opinion, again, is to be found by the state.
the third my lord, is the concept of creamy layer.
what my lord justice vikram nath had put it that, once you've achieved it, do you still get the entitlement to remain within the backward classes or not?
and the fourth, of course, is efficiency of services, that whether provision of such reservation will eventually amount to compromising the efficiency of services under 335, because that is also your constitutional obligation.
therefore, indra sawhney there can't be reservation in certain type of post.
yes, certain type of post, not beyond 50%, not without going into the checks and balances.
so therefore, the exercise my lord in my humble submission, is pretty comprehensive.
your lordships are right. why a state cannot give 70 and the other state give 30 and the other state give 20?
when they do it, it will be up for judicial review based upon the quantifiable data on the strength of which such a decision has been taken.
has the exercise been done in punjab yet?
done in punjab? yes. i'm sure in tamil nadu, yes.
i'm sure whichever state has done it, they are expected to and would have carried out this exercise.
but that, as i was saying my lord, a three judge or a five judge bench will decide, that whether that exercise, which has been done is susceptible to judicial review, and if so...
the high court struck it down only on the grounds of chinnaiah.
yes, chinnaiah. that you cannot classify further for the...
that this amounts to tinkering with 341.
that was the entire summon substance of it.
and in the davinder singh, my lord, their lordships held that, that may not be the correct thing, because 341 and 16(4) operate in two distinct legislative spheres.
they have no overlapping as far as their implementation is concerned because, as i put it, 341 decides who's entitled for benefits, who to be given how much, within those entitled, is the exercise by the state.
so therefore, my humble submission was, that unless this exercise is permitted by law, if you block it, then what your lordships call, will happen, is the word called 'lumping'.
then all the benefits will be lumped upon a part of the park, and the others who are truly deserving, for whom these provisions have been made, to achieve the eventual end of equality will never get it, my lords have rightly put it.
justice gavai. ias, ips... even if somebody is an inspector, his family has made it.
his children will go to a good school.
he will be in a city or a town or an urban estate, but for somebody who's still sitting in that part of the village from where you're not allowed to draw water from the well, he's the one who needs it.
you cannot allow lumping of benefits with a certain class within a class.
and if touching that class within a class is taken to be tinkering of 341, in my humble submission, that would be an erroneous legal view.
nobody intended reservation to be a perpetual concept.
nobody, not even the constitution framers felt, because we've had studies, we've had mandal commissions, we've had judgments.
nobody wanted that reservation should remain in perpetuity, because eventually, then that would mean that the exercise of reservation itself has failed.
the idea is to achieve equality in the lowest time frame possible.
my lords, are looking at the clock.
i was just going to tell you that.
the problem on being on this side of the bench is that that clock constantly ticks in my face.
so let's get on... i understand your lordships view point that this is definitely at the cost of some other case.
this is the core of the matter.
you've laid down your jurisprudential foundation, no doubt about it.
very well. let me start with the statutory provision.
before we go into anything at all in this matter, what is very essential...
where do we get the act actually?
can you just tell us? the act is a part of the volume 4, page 1.
after the index my lord, there is the punjab scheduled castes act.
your lords have it? volume 4, page 1.
page 1. and your lordships would have the offending provision at internal page 3, which was section 4 and sub-section 5.
as a first preference from among the scheduled castes.
yes, that is what i was trying to impress, that it is not exclusion in the sense that we take it, but it is only first preference amongst the scheduled castes and then...
and if available. yes, then it will remain within the scheduled castes.
nobody will be denied the benefit by virtue of this clause.
because we need to now see who are we dealing with.
that is also part of volume 4 or you want us to take the book?
whichever way, my lord. the constitution is not...
my lords may have the book because the entire constitution need not...
yes, we've not put it in the compilation.
in this constitution, my lords... it's mr. sankaranarayanan's gift to the legal profession.
the good part about this is that, it has footnotes placing the entire legislative history.
so, right at one point then you don't have to flip between amending acts, amending statutes or constitutional amendments.
it is a book which, by habit, every lawyer should carry in his breast pocket.
i know your lordships' affection for the constitution.
my court master, says the library has purchased this.
mr. sankaranarayanan gifted us with one copy, i think.
last time mr. sankaranarayanan gave one. it must have gone home i think.
you can sign it and give it to me. we have it on our table in the residential offices.
if your lordships have 366? it says, definitions.
'in this constitution, unless the context otherwise requires, the following expressions have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say', my lords may straight away come to 23.
schedule, my lords have it? 'schedule means a schedule to this constitution, 24. "scheduled castes".' now my lords, if your lordships would realise, this is kept in inverted commas.
'scheduled caste is defined as means such caste, races or tribes or parts of or groups within such castes, races or tribes as are deemed under article 341 to be scheduled castes for the purposes of this constitution.' so the definition has been directly linked with 341, and similarly, in the case of scheduled tribes, my lord, it means 'such tribes or tribal communities or parts or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under article 342 to be scheduled tribes for the purposes of this constitution'.
so we'll straightaway go to 341 my lord, because that will tell us, though the language is quite para materia, my lords may have 341, the only thing we will get from there is who can do it.
may i my lords? 1) 'the president may with respect to any state or union territory and where it is a state after consultation with the governor, thereof by public notification specify the castes, races or tribes or parts of groups within the castes, races or tribes, which shall for the purpose of this constitution be deemed to be scheduled castes in relation to that state or union territory, as the case may be'.
so my lord i'll just analyse this in a very short while.
it's very clear that the authority my lord empowered to do this exercise under 341 is the president under clause 1.
now when he is exercising this power my lord, with respect to any state or union territory and when there is a state in consultation with the governor.
so this my lord the consultative process, which is undertaken.
there is no dispute regarding the issuance of an order.
and it is to be done by way of notification, no problem.
the interesting part starts after notification and which is very germane to the present controversy that i'm arguing before your lordships.
why? because even while defining as to whom 341 can be exercised, it is not a monolith block.
my lords may kindly take note of it.
when 341 itself says that it has to specify a caste as a whole, races or tribes or parts of or groups within castes.
that means a caste can most certainly be split, it's evident.
if caste was so sacrosanct that anything would amount to tinkering with the caste, then 341 would not be couched in this language.
because the president can choose that this caste, for instance, i'll give your lordships an example a caste is a scheduled caste in punjab may not be in maharashtra.
the same caste may not be in maharashtra.
that's why somebody who's designated as a scheduled caste in punjab, if they go to maharashtra, they may not get the benefit.
they will not get the same benefit.
also at one time there used to be territorial restrictions which were abolished after 1976.
so even though you are designated as a scheduled caste, you could get the benefit only if you belong to that particular region in your state....
quite right. districts, yeah. now after 1976 that territorial division was done away with, but it was there until 1976.
it was there. so, my lord very interestingly, your lordships have rightly put it.
certain tribes in general district of maharashtra may not be in the other parts of the state.
so my lord, yes, that is what i was coming to.
that the same caste in one state may not be a scheduled caste in the other.
the same caste may be a scheduled caste in a state, but maybe a scheduled caste only in a particular district of another state.
the same caste my lord may be commonly designated as a scheduled caste for many states.
so therefore, they say that all will be defined in the part to the schedule, but therefore the definite conclusion which arises from reading this definition is that caste in itself is not an indivisible entity, number one.
and under definition of 341 it most certainly is not a monolith block.
it is not something which is which is to be taken as eradicator of birth marks.
no. we all know the birthmark philosophy, my lord, that once you become a scheduled caste then you lose your birth mark, you're only a scheduled caste.
it doesn't happen in 341. there are two reasons why.
one, that, as we have already seen, a caste once it enters the scheduled caste maybe a scheduled caste in a state or a district or more than one state.
so therefore, you will have the benefits of the schedule only if you are within the definition so ascribed to you in the order issued by the president, as amended by the parliament.
that thing is very clear. two, why it is not a monolith?
it is because it is a reversible process.
it is a reversible process. today you can say that a caste is a scheduled caste in three districts of punjab, for instance, i'm only taking an academic example.
tomorrow you may reverse that status for one of those three districts also.
but now area restrictions are not possible.
no restrictions? no, that has been done away with.
no. the parliament can say that this scheduled caste has, suppose it is located next to an urban centre, people of that particular district have risen in affluence and have the opportunity to compete, they may exclude that district.
the parliament may, in its wisdom. the parliament has the power, because any group of persons in that caste also...
that's right my lord. so therefore it's not an irreversible process.
so therefore, when you are saying that even within a caste, you can create parts and for this, all we have to do is, we'll go to the presidential order in respect of any state, and this example will be laid bare as to what i'm trying to say.
now the issue is, why are they called scheduled caste?
because this word has become very generic.
he's a scheduled caste. why? because, his caste for that particular area is contained in the schedule.
that's all. a scheduled caste is not a caste, as we commonly think.
a scheduled caste is a person whose caste is included in the schedule, for a particular area of a state or variation thereof in the manner that we have discussed.
if the parliament removes a particular caste from the schedule, it can remove a caste.
that caste would cease to be a scheduled caste.
would cease to be a scheduled caste.
that doesn't mean he's not a caste, which was backward, is backward, or continues to be backward.
but if the parliament, in its wisdom, removes that caste, or the parliament, in one context, removes a part of that caste or a group of that caste, because there's a lot of interpretation, given in milind and other judgments, that you can either put a comma where there are castes which denote the same category of people, they are known by different names, or you can put a sub-caste in a bracket.
that is not permissible. it can be done only by parliament.
the court can't... i am saying you can.
you meaning the parliament. the parliament can do it.
that they can amend it, put a sub-caste in a bracket along with the main castes.
they can put a comma and add a caste to a particular entry where the caste is synonymous with the caste already entered, or they can add or delete a part of that caste on a territorial basis.
this power is endowed to the parliament, most certainly, and that has been recognized by your lordships.
now... in fact 15(4) specifically, article 15(4) specifically refers to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
16(4) has no reference to scheduled castes and tribes at all.
it refers to any backward class of citizens, who in the opinion of the state, are inadequately represented in the services of the state.
now, because 16(4) uses that generic expression, any backward class of citizens, that will, of necessity, include the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
that's right. but 15(4), your lordships are aware, came later, right.
it was by way of a subsequent amendment.
so maybe, by the first amendment the framers got wiser that, why not specify.
why not specify? it was a result of champakam dorairajan.
it was a result of champakam judgement.
so, the effort was to make the intent very clear that when we say backward classes, as in 16(4), we mean backward scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
though, that will not have an effect on the merits because the backwardness, the only thin line that we've seen has been drawn is that backwardness in case of obcs can be tested, while backwardness in the case of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes is presumed.
a state cannot go into the exercise of determination of backwardness as one of the four parameters for grant of benefits.
now, the only word i was struggling with, and i was looking for guidance from your lordships is this word 'deemed'.
i was discussing with mr. farasat also in the morning, it troubles me. why would the constitution framers use this word 'deem'?
my only explanation was, because it is not an exercise in perpetuity.
so for that period of time, a deeming fiction is attached to that caste.
it could be the read as deemed to be scheduled castes in relation to that state.
that's what i'm saying. that's the only explanation that i could...
could be included in the lease for that state, it will be deemed to be scheduled caste for that particular state, not for the other states.
why i say so is, that otherwise, normally as we interpret statutes, your lordships are far more experienced.
clearly said that in relation to state has been construed to a particular state only.
if we take the word deemed out of it, does it change the sense of the article?
then it would be, shall, for the purposes of this constitution be, scheduled castes in relation to that state or union territory, why deem?
i could not come up with an explanation, so therefore, i'm leaving it my lord, at that, because...
the reason is that, what article 341 does is, it recognizes the sociological existence of castes.
whereas, article 342 recognizes the sociological existence of tribes.
that's right. having done so, it creates an artificial grouping called scheduled caste in 341, and scheduled tribes in 342.
sociologically there is no scheduled caste as such.
that's what i was saying. scheduled caste is an expression, which the constitution has adopted for the conferment of benefits on these communities.
so therefore, it uses the expression 'deem' to highlight that this is really a deeming fiction which is being created to...
attaching to a particular caste. yes. the existing sociological grouping consists of castes which 341 fares in 342.
my lord, i'll put it, as justice gavai said...
or, it could be read for the purposes of article 46.
article 46 refers to scheduled castes and schedule tribes.
that's right. no, no, but my... though 15(4) has come subsequently, 46 is from inception.
quite right. it will be deemed to be schedule caste and 46 provides for the special provisions for scheduled caste and scheduled tribes and weaker sections.
and the caste is by birth. caste is by birth.
this is the deeming fiction. second, article 341 also contemplated, apart from castes, races or tribes can also be a scheduled caste.
that's right. it's not only a caste, which can be designated as a scheduled caste under 341, but races or tribes can also be designated as scheduled caste, because it says specify the castes, races or tribes or parts of groups within caste, races are tribes, which shall be designated as scheduled caste.
so, it recognizes this could be an amorphous group of castes, races, tribes, groups within caste, races or tribes, or parts of caste, races and tribes.
which can be designated. and therefore, the reason why they use the word deeming or deemed, is that it is really a fiction which is created for the purpose of this constitution.
that's right. the caste will remain, whether you're in or out.
the caste will remain. the tribe remains.
the race remains. those groups within, they don't lose their identity.
the identity as caste, races or tribes, their sociological identity continues despite their being deemed to be scheduled caste for the purpose of the constitution.
that's right. that's the only explanation i could think of my lord.
and the other thing was my lord, that if tribes can be scheduled caste, it would have an overlapping effect, which doesn't reconcile with the framing of the constitution.
then why have two different? if tribes can be a part of scheduled castes, then there is a separate provision for tribes in 342.
under what article would the president issue an order of a tribe?
it can't be either under 341 or 342.
342 doesn't include caste under it. it doesn't.
but 341 includes a tribe. it includes a tribe.
so, therefore, an overlapping jurisdiction as far as the tribes is concerned.
but this is in recognition of the fact, that tribes and castes were not, in that sense, watertight compartments all over the country.
in some states or in some in the case of some castes, that castes will not include a tribe at all.
in other states, possibly the constitution took a broader perspective, that there may be certain castes which are akin to tribal communities, and therefore 341, they give a much broader power.
possibly. 342 says, only tribes and tribal communities.
right. because there would be some states in india my lord, where there are no scheduled castes.
they only have a tribal community, which is ...
like andaman nicobar or.... yes. northeast my lord, one or two states where they are classified only under 342.
there are no orders of 341 in those states.
there are some states, where there's virtually no scheduled tribe.
that's right. none whatsoever. punjab my lord.
punjab, haryana could be. none. the reservation of scheduled tribes was on the ground of...
... went from punjab my lord. was on the ground of geographical handicaps.
that's right. where else 341 schedule caste is account of socio-economic backwardness.
quite right. like in punjab, my lord, we have sikhridar and we have rai sikhs.
rai sikhs were a 'criminal tribal community, but they're always being categorized as castes.
so, different headings were given to them.
one which has been entered now. that's exactly.
that's very important because that shows that though they were essentially tribes, they've been classified as caste for the purpose of article 341.
that's right. so, therefore, what we have to understand is that the president issues an order which may or may not be not be in perpetuity.
we have to understand that. because while issuing the order, what the constitution very fairly recognises is, that the president, after the issuance of that order, cannot change that order.
so, in case there is any error in the order issued or in case because of the sociological conditions a caste or a tribe or a race needs to be added to that order, the parliament, in its wisdom, would do that exercise which also is challengeable, my lord on very, very narrow spectrum.
where is the presidential order here? yes, i am coming to that.
kindly, have the schedule. volume 4 is there in the...
my lords have the volume 4?. it is bookmarked my lord and if your lordship would have the second last document, the constitution, my lord, is wrongly typed.
it is scheduled caste order and the third last is scheduled tribes.
kindly have the second last. page 1371 it starts.
1371. now what i've just stated before, your lordships would become clear from here.
my lords have 1371? yes. if your lordships would straight away come, my lord to part 1, andhra pradesh, and if your lordships would have clause 4, that empowers the interpretation by saying that any reference in this order to a state or to a district or other territorial division thereof shall be construed as a reference to state, district, or territorial division as constituted on the 1st of may 1976.
so when we see andhra my lord, if your lordships would come to 1372, entry number 9 my lord.
it has all the contingencies that i was pointing out.
my lord, it has a caste called beda.
if your lordship would have it.. in the districts of hyderabad, rangareddy.
no, first of all, it has beda, then it has (budga), which means budga's are also bedas.
jangam in the districts of now, jangam is a separate caste, but it's at the same entry, but only in selective districts of andhra pradesh.
so, therefore, my lord, in line with what the constitution is saying...
beda jangam? that's right. caste is beda jangam and it could be budga jangam also.
that's right. it has to be read in continuation because otherwise...
that's right. it is beda jangam. because otherwise, there will be a comma in between.
that's right. there's no comma. so it's either interchangeable with beda or budga.
so it could be beda jangam or budga jangam.
my lords are right. and in selective districts or andhra pradesh.
now your lordships would see entry 30.
there they possibly are synonymous castes which have been subsequently added, which are my lord kolupul valdu, pambada, pambanda and pambala.
now they are interspersed with a comma meaning thereby that the entry is one, but they may be inter-changeable.
either of them? yes. why my lord, this is very important is that if, in such an entry, a person, my lord, who is born into one of these castes.
say, for instance, he is born as a pambala but he gets a scheduled caste certificate of pambada, it will be recognised, because it is synonymous and that will not disentitle him.
14 also, chamar, mochi. that's right, that's right.
mochi, chamar ravidass, chamar rohidas. so they are all a part of one entry.
when we come to this, it's a caste.
now, why 341 was made sacrosanct, is we can just refer to this and understand that, as my lords had put it, tomorrow, a state feels that, forget about the scheduled caste status of this caste.
it has a population of 12% in my state.
if i give them the benefit of scheduled caste by tinkering of the list of under 341, i can get voter friendly.
to avoid that mischief, your lordships held 341 as far as the entry and exit is concerned, is sacrosanct.
no state in the federal structure will be able to tinker with the entry and exit or a caste or a part thereof, or a race or a group or a part thereof, while exercising the powers which are not vested in it.
that was the reason. what milind and the subsequent judgment says is this, it is not for conferring of benefits at all, which chinnaiah interprets it to be.
it is not a theory of inclusion or exclusion at all.
so therefore, my lord, the principal argument that 341 and 16(4) operate in completely different legislative spheres.
the word used there is state. it could either be centre or the state government.
and they can, in their opinion confer the benefits which they are enabled to provide under 16, in the manner that they deem fit.
the provision of those benefits in the ratio as the state decides, is definitely open to judicial review, but it is not tinkering with the list.
that is the principal argument on which we propose to, my lord, seek the setting aside of chinnaiah, is that it does not tinker with 341.
so now, my lords would have the punjab list, which was an issue in my case.
1381, part 3. now the statute said balmiki, because balmiki is synonymous with chooda and bhangi at entry 2 and it said mazhabi, which is interchangeable with mazhabi sikh, at entry 23.
the statute uses the word balmiki and mazhabi and mazhabi sikhs.
mazhabi sikh. so, mazhabi sikh and mazhabi, as per the order, is interchangeable.
it's interspersed with a comma. and so is my lord, balmiki with chooda or bhangi.
but your act doesn't say so. act doesn't say so.
so we'll have to refer back to the constitution to say if somebody holds a certificate as a bhangi, he will be considered for the benefit...
so he will not be denied the benefit under 4(5).
my lords are right. so that is the intent.
but then, if you are giving that preferential treatment, it will be only for balmiki, or balmiki, chooda and bhangi?
no, we are giving to balmiki, as at entry 2, along with the caste entailed therein, and mazhabi at entry number 23 with the caste entailed therein, interspersed by a comma.
because they are, according to the constitution, as indicated, that these other two communities are also synonymous.
and these are included in that, though really the statute has used only one, balmiki and mazhabi sikhs.
that's right. now, if your lordship would see, at serial number 37, is a caste called sikriband and serial number 39 are two castes, which are mahatam, rai sikh.
now, as the proposal of the state was that, mahatam is the principal caste and sikriband - sikribands are those people who weave rope from jute.
so sikribands and rai sikhs, which i was just referring to, who were a criminal community, used to engage in the occupation of weaving of rope and making beds and chairs with the help of that rope.
they were engaged in that vocation. the proposal was that, include mahatam and rai sikh with a comma at sikriband.
but the parliament decided, 'no we will include them as a separate entity, at a separate place, interspersed with a comma, but not synonymous with sikriband. now, the problem is that a lot of people from rai sikhas and mahatams had certificates as sikriband, because they actually belong to that cast. in any case, that litigation i'm doing in the high court.
so, just sharing it with your lordship.
so, there this whole interpretation of milind and comma and a separate entry, we are engaged in the debate my lord, that whether, if historically, they are a part of the same community engaged in the same vocation, which confers the same benefit amongst them as a caste.
why should they be given the benefit not from 76 but from 50 when sikriband was entered as a schedule caste.
now mr. advocate general, we have seen why jurisprudentially you are saying that chinnaiah is not a correct, has not interpreted the constitution correctly because there's no question of inclusion or exclusion.
that's right. 16(4) is enabling. enabling. 341 designation.
that's right. now, should we go to the judgments and see what is there...
my lord, we'll just read quickly, 15 and 16, because that is the whole basis of my argument.
there's only one distinction between 15(4) and 16(4).
16(4) doesn’t use the word 'any'. 'any'.
which 15(4) uses. does that make any difference?
because, 15(4) says 'any'... may provide benefit for any socially and educationally backward class of citizens.
my lord, 15(4) says 'special provision'. 'special provision'.
and 16(4) says 'any'. right. no 15(4) says, 'any'.
no, my lord. 15(4), says special provision.
for making any special provision. that's right for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens...
your lordships, are talking about the second 'any'.
yes, the second 'any'. alright. and there is a difference if your lordships, would have 15(4) first...
why i'm asking you this... let's just read 15(4) and 16(4) my lord.
right. let's see. 15, 16(4)... because the other sub-clauses are not relevant.
it says nothing in this article or in clause 2 of article 29, shall prevent the state, the state in this case, meaning either the centre or the state, from making any special provision for advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, or for the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes.
now, my lord, the word here could have been anything.
because instead of 'or' the word could have been 'including'.
it is not including. so, when we see the intent, it means that it distinguishes backward classes...
i didn't get you. if your lordships, would see the word between backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes.
it can have two meanings. one, that you can make a law exclusively for backward class of citizens or for scheduled caste and schedule tribes, but in definite form it recognizes the distinction between backward classes and scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, because in 16(4), the deeming inclusion of scheduled castes is there in backward class.
come after champakam. maybe she was belonging to scheduled castes.
that's right. and that  was challenged, wherein the reservation was provided for scheduled caste.
they said, and our court said that you cannot have community based reservations and admissions, that would ever be taken away.
scheduled caste and scheduled tribes is there.
but 16(4) there from inception. that's right.
now if your lordship would see... you know the only thing, i mean nothing will turn on this case.
but there's a little issue here. 15(4) says, from making any special provision.
any special provision, that means any kind of special provision.
that's right. for the advancement of any socially and educational backward class of citizen.
that is, the state can pick out any socially and educationally backward class of citizens.
because there is no, it's not like a presidential designation here or for the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe.
can the state under 15(4) say i'm going to make a special provision for only these scheduled castes in my state or these scheduled tribes in my state?
or, is it bound, if you make that special provision, that it must apply to all scheduled castes and tribes in the state.
because, any in 15(4) qualifies only the formers, especially socially and educationally background class of citizens are not schedule caste and schedule tribe.
that's right. so as far as the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes are concerned.
you must treat them together as one unit.
exactly. you may make the provision for all, but as far as the internal, my lord that will come in 16 (4), where you can limit extent or reserve within that category.
16(4) is even more clear. yes, kindly have it.
because 16(4) says nothing in this article shall prevent the state from making any provision, like there any special provision, any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens.
any backward class. so any backward class of citizens could include scheduled caste and scheduled tribes, scheduled caste and scheduled tribes my lord..
in which case the state can considerably say that, well, though these scheduled castes have been designated in my state, in my opinion out of them only these are not adequately represented in my services.
so my lord the recording of opinion.....
in maharashtra there may be 29 and in another state x number of scheduled castes.
you can say in my state, the inadequacy of representation applies only to these.
that's right. therefore, i'm going to make this provision only for these.
only for these. but why 16(4) qualifies it unlike 15(4), a recording of an opinion is necessary..
of inadequacy of representation inadequacy of representation, which is not in 15(4).
so 16(4) as enacted my lord, in fact, places a check and balance on the power of the state when exercised talking of adequacy, of representation.
so therefore, those four checks and balances...
realistically, if you look at it textually, the punjab legislative measure, which reserves 50% for these two communities, balmikis and mazhabi sikhs.
balmikis and mazhabi sikhs. yes. can that also not be justified in the ground.
that in regards to the relative representation amongst the scheduled castes, these two communities are the least represented within the represented group.
that's right my lord. that's right. so it can be either or.
one, that they continue to be extremely backward...
and they continue to be the least represented in the services of the state.
and or ... therefore a more special treatment among the special...
yes. so that's why i qualified it in the beginning, that it can be and/or.
that quantifiable data and all is not before us.
we are only on the broader contextual scenario.
so therefore, my lord in scheduled caste that issue will come up because when they say backward class, as far as scheduled caste within the backward class is concerned, you cannot apply the test of backwardness.
right, but you still have to  you have to apply.
inadequacy of representation.... yes, three tests will still remain.
inadequacy of representation will remain then my lord efficiency of services as countered by 335 will remain and my lord creamy layer, which is a law in progress..
jarnail has applied. yes my lord, that is still work in progress, but as it stands today, creamy layer will apply to scheduled caste also because within the backward classes, as defined by 16(4) in the case of scheduled caste, there's a presumption of backwardness..
yes which there isn't in the case of the sc/bc, especially an educationally background.
so therefore, this debate followed that when there is a presumption of backwardness but they have attained the forwardness to severe the umbilical cord which attaches them to the definition of backward classes, will they be excluded from the benefit or not?
nobody is saying they will become de-scheduled, scheduled caste they will remain but they may not be entitled to the benefits which are under 16(4) to be given only to backward classes.
so the moment they become forward enough to declassify themselves as backward classes, they will be disentitled to the benefits which flow from 16(4).
because creamy layer is not a caste based concept.
it is an individual concept. it's an economic concept.
it's an economic, educational or a sociological.
it can be either. could be. could be either that the caste has come up socially to a very even platform with the other castes or educationally.
most of them are educated or economically, five families of that caste who shifted to the capital town have risen to an extent where, as you your lordships put it that they have severed the link between backwardness and them.
and the moment that link goes they are disentitled to benefits.
now, what's next mr. attorney general? yes, now, your lordships would only have one more article my lord which, of course, is below 46 your lordships have seen we all know.
then my lord 335 which is one of the tests my lord which says the claims of members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in making of appointments to the services and posts in connection with the affairs of union or the state.
so, why i say so this, that this is now relatable to entry 41 in list 2 and entry 61 in list 1 and entry 25 in the concurrent list, which pertains to services, though i don't, in my humble submission, think that there is any direct contact between the controversy at hand and the exercise of power of legislative or executive intent through those entries.
i don't think that will detain your lordships, but chinnaiah proceeds on this, that you cannot exercise powers under 41 and 25, being a state, because this would amount to tinkering with the intent of 341.
so, my lord, in my humble submission, that argument is misplaced.
so i will not dwell on it much.
then your lordship would have commission for scheduled caste, which they say that everything has to be routed through them and then the 338a, which is for scheduled tribes.
i'm just skipping them because they may not be of relevance in this controversy.
and 341 we've read and the list i've seen.
now, straight away we can come to the judgments.
in chinnaiah, my lord, there are 3 orders.
the first, which i'll read, what has come to your lordships, is the reference order volume?
volume v. volume v there are three orders.
v(a), v(b) and... page 1400, the third last bookmark.
volume v? just one second. first, your lordship would have v(a), because that is an order prior in time, roman five small a. in this, the last bookmark, davinder singh, which is the matter before your lordships.
pdf page for that? page 247 in volume v(a), roman five, small a, pdf 249, the last order.
v(a), 249? that's right. pdf 249, running page 247.
this is in civil appeal, 2317. that is justice lodha, justice joseph and justice nariman.
this is the order of 2020, volume viii, scc 65.
though the order interestingly is of 2014.
i was wondering how 2020  justice lodha.
an order of 20th august, my lords may note.
the order of 20th august of 2014 by a three judge bench.
yes. it says the learned counsel for the respondents heavily relies upon the constitution bench decision of e.v. chinnaiah vs state of ap.
on the other hand, the learned additional solicitor general for the appellants submits that e.v. chinnaiah has no application on the controversy in hand.
moreover, he submits that e.v. chinnaiah is not in accord with the nine judge bench of this court in indra sawhney vs union of india.
having heard the additional solicitor general and the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the view that e.v. chinnaiah needs to be revisited in the light of article 338 of the constitution of india and inter alia, exposition of law in indra sawhney.
moreover, the matter also involves interpretation and interplay between 16(1), article 16(4), article 338 and article 341 of the constitution of india as well.
in this view of the matter, we refer the matter for consideration of the above aspects by the larger bench.
let the matter be placed before the chief justice.
then comes the order, which i was earlier pointing out in volume v, the third last bookmark pdf, page 1404.
volume v. this is my lord, an order of 27th of august 2020.
volume v. page? 1404. and in this my lord, if your lordship, would come to the concluding part of the judgment.
so, three placed it before five and then five placed it before seven.
that's right. my lord, in this judgment, if your lordship, would kindly have para 49 on page 1460...
1464 pdf my lord, which is in contra to the earlier finding of chinnaiah, providing a percentage.
my lords, have it? yes. providing a percentage of the reservation within permissible limit is within the power of the state legislatures.
it cannot be deprived of its concurrent power to make reasonable classification within the particular classes of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and socially and educationally backward classes, without depriving others in the list.
to achieve the real purpose of reservation within constitutional dynamics, needy can always be given benefit.
otherwise, it would mean that inequality is being perpetuated within the class, if preferential classification is not made ensuring benefit to all.
the sub-classification is to achieve the very purpose as envisaged in the original classification itself and based thereupon, evolved the very concept of reservation, whether the subclassification would be a further extension of principle of the said dynamics, is the question to be considered authoritatively by this court.
and, 52 my lord, they say, what exactly is the mind of the court.
the state has competence to grant reservation benefit to the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes, in terms of article 15(4) and 16(4).
and also article 341(1) and 342(1). it prescribes the extent/percentage of reservation to different classes.
the state government can decide the manner and quantum of reservation.
as such, the state can also make sub-classification when providing reservation to all scheduled castes in the list based on a rationale, that would conform with the very spirit of article 14,15 and 16 of the constitution providing reservation.
the state government cannot tamper with the list.
it can neither include nor exclude any caste in the list or make an inquiry whether any synonym exists, as held in milind.
and then my lord, the next paragraph 51.
coming back my lord, the scheduled caste, because of that transient nature of the list my lord, the scheduled caste as a presidential list are not frozen for all time and neither they are homogeneous group, as is evident from the vast anthropological and statistical data collected by various commissions.
the state law of preferential treatment to a limited extent, does not amend the list.
it adopts the list, as it is.
the state law intends to provide reservation for all scheduled castes in a pragmatic manner, based on statistical data, it distributes the benefits of reservation based on the needs of each scheduled caste.
so my lord if it all, there is an application of mind in 341 for inclusion and exclusion, the application of mind for dissemination of benefits is only under 16(4), only under 16(4), no other provision.
we can go back to chinnaiah and see what was, what weighed with their lordship's mind, to give that judgment and how it has been distinguished, my lord, in the davinder singh's reference order and i'll come to the other judgments like indra sawhney, that is more generic in nature.
chinnaiah is my lord volume v, page 774 my lord.
pdf is 778, it's the 6th bookmark after the index.
774 or 778? pdf 778. pdf 778.
pdf 778. my lord the principal judgment is by justice n. santosh hegde, on behalf of himself and justice variava and justice singh.
my lord, what brought this matter to the supreme court, was the leave granted by the andhra pradesh high court.
the issue emanated from a report of a commission headed by justice ramachandra raju.
and the scope of this commission was to identify, that within the list notified under article 341 for andhra pradesh, please identify who had failed to secure the benefit of reservations, provided for scheduled caste in the state, in admission to professional colleges and appointment to services in the state.
my lord, in pursuance of this report, the commission opined, that within the 15%, reservation for backward classes in the state educational institution, and services of the state under 15(4) and 16(4), the scheduled caste were primarily apportioned in four groups, in the following manner.
they identified those four groups in para 2.
for reservation my lord, group a- 1%, group b- 7%, group c- 6% and group d- 1%, showing that group a and d, were hugely under represented.
then my lord, an ordinance was issued and thereafter, which was my lord, made an act of 2000, both were challenged and the matter came to this hon'ble court, after the high court dismissed the challenge by 4:1.
para 5, my lord, the contentions were my lord, the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellants are, that the state legislature has no competence to make any law, in regard to bifurcation of the presidential list of scheduled caste, prepared under article 34(1) of the constitution.
therefore, the impugned legislation being one solely meant for sub-dividing or sub-grouping, the caste enumerated in the presidential list, the same suffers from lack of legislative competence.
it is further submitted, that once the castes are put in the presidential list, the said castes become one homogeneous class, for all purposes under the constitution.
there could be no further division of the said castes, in the scheduled list, by any act of the state legislature.
his further submission was that in the guise of exercising its legislative competence, under entry 41 in list 2 or entry 25 of list 3, the state legislature cannot exercise its legislative power, so as to make a law, tinkering with the presidential list, because the said entries do not permit any law being made in regard to scheduled castes, in guise of providing opportunity to some of the cast in list of scheduled castes in state cannot invoke entry 41 of list 2 and entry 25 of list 3.
divide the schedule caste according to the learned counsel for the impugned enactment does not really deal with the field of legislation, contemplated under the said entries, but in reality, is targeted to subdivide the schedule caste.
alternatively, he submitted that the classification or sub-grouping made in the state legislature- amounted to subclassification or micro classification of schedule caste is violative of article 14 of the constitution.
then, my lord, 3389 argument is there in para 7.
my lord, come to mr. venugopal's argument in para 8.
on behalf of the respondent shri k. k. venugopal and a senior counsel appearing for the state who led the argument on behalf of the respondents contended, that article 341, only empowers the president to specify the caste in the presidential list and the parliament to include or exclude from the specified list any caste or tribe, and beyond that, no further legislative or executive power is vested with the union or india or parliament to decide to what extent the caste included in the scheduled castes list, should be given the benefit of reservation, which, according to the learned counsel, depended upon their degree of backwardness.
his further argument is, that authority to decide to provide reservation or not, and if yes, then the quantum of reservation to be provided, is the exclusive privilege of the state in that process, the state will have to keep in mind the extent of backwardness of a group, be it other backward classes, scheduled caste or schedule tribe.
therefore, having found a class of persons within the scheduled caste is having been deprived of such benefits.
the state has the exclusive legislative power, to make such grouping for reservation under article 15(4) and 16(4), of the constitution, subject, of course, to article 245, 246 of the constitution, since in the instant case, there is no allegation that there has been any violation of article 245, 246.
the argument of lack of legislative competence, advanced on behalf of the appellant should fail.
he further submitted, that there is an obligation on the state under article 16(4), to identify the group of backward class or citizens, which in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in the service under the state and make reservation in their favour for such appointments, and under article 15(4) of the constitution, there is an obligation on the state to make special provisions for the advancement of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes and what the state has sought to do, under the impugned act, was only to make such provisions to fulfil the constitutional obligation, after due inquiry.
hence, the allegation of violation of article 14, cannot be sustained.
he strongly relied on the findings of fact, recorded in justice raju commission report, which according to him establishes that some particular groups within the scheduled caste, have cornered all the benefits, at the cost of others, in the said list.
therefore, with a view to see that the benefit of reservation percolates to the weaker of the weakest, it had become necessary to enact the impugned law.
the learned counsel submitted, that by re-grouping the caste in the scheduled caste list, there is no re-classification or micro classification as contended by the appellants.
then my lord the basis of that report is given, which was on the basis of the constituent assembly debates and so on and so forth.
my lords, may straight away now come to questions framed in paragraph 12.
my lords have it? yes. whether the impugned act is violative of article 341(2) of the constitution of india, whether the impugned enactment is constitutionally invalid, for the lack of legislative competence, whether the impugned enactment creates sub-classification or micro-classification of scheduled caste, so as to violate article 14, of the constitution of india?
though my lord touched on fringes, surprisingly, the interplay of 16(4) and 341 was not even framed as a question.
completely dehors the constitutional power under 15(4) and 16(4), because essentially the court proceeds on the conflict between 341 and entry 41 and 25.
it was argued, but not my lord, essentially, i would say, considered as it should have been.
i'll now come to the findings, starting from paragraph 13, my lord.
may i, my lord? yes. we will first consider the effect of article 341 of the constitution and examine whether the state could, in the guise of providing reservation for the weaker of the weakest, tinker with the presidential list by sub-dividing the castes, mentioned in the presidential list into different groups.
article 341, which is found in part 16 of the constitution, refers to special provisions relating to certain classes, which includes the scheduled caste.
the article provides, that the president may, with respect to any state or union territory, after consultation with the governor by public notification, specify that caste, races, or tribe or parts of, or groups within caste, races or tribe, which shall, for the purposes of constitution, be deemed to be scheduled caste in relation to that state or union territory.
now my lord, here they give their opinion.
this indicates, that there can only be one list of scheduled caste, in relation to a state, and that list should, include all specified castes, races or tribes or part of groups notified in the presidential list, any exclusion or inclusion from the said list can only be done by the parliament, under 341 (2) of the constitution.
in the entire constitution, wherever reference has been made to scheduled caste, it refers only to the list prepared by the president under article 341, and there is no reference to any sub-classification or division in the said list, except maybe for limited purposes of article 330, which refers to reservation for seats for schedule casts in the house of people, which is not applicable to the facts of the case.
it is also clear from 341 that, except for a limited power of making exclusion or inclusion in the list by an act of parliament, there is no provision either to sub-divide, sub classify, or sub-group, these castes which are found in the presidential list of schedule castes.
therefore, it is clear that the constitution intended all the castes, including the sub-caste, races and tribes mentioned in the list, to be members of one group for the purposes of the constitution and this group, would not be sub-divided for any purpose.
a reference to the constituent assembly in this regard may be useful at this stage.
what they rely upon is, while discussing 341, if your lordship, would have, the in court part, the page is bottom of 780, pdf 794, para 14, it forms a part of.
the object of these two articles, as i stated, was to eliminate the necessity of burdening the constitution, with a long list of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
it is now proposed, that the president in consultation with a governor or ruler of a state, should have the power to issue a general notification in the gazette, specifying all castes and tribes or groups thereof, deemed to be scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for the purposes of privileges, which have been defined for them in the constitution.
the only limitation that has been imposed is that, once a notification has been issued by the president, which undoubtedly he will be issuing in consultation with and on the advice of the government of each state, thereafter if any elimination was to be made, from the list so notified, or any addition was to be made, that must be made by the parliament and not the president.
the object, now, my lord, this is the italicized part, the object is to eliminate any kind of political factors having a play in the matter of disturbance in the schedule so published by the president.
because they felt that, any kind of provision made to a group within the scheduled list, will amount to political interference with the list.
right. a discussion that ensued in regard to the framing of this article indicates, that there was an attempt on the part of some of the members of the constituent assembly, to empower the states also, to interfere with the list prepared by the president under the said article.
as a matter of fact, an amendment to this effect was also moved by shri kuldharshila who, while moving the said amendment, stated, that the amendment 201 of list 5, in clause 2, of the proposed article 300b, after the words 'parliament may' the words 'and', 'subject to' its decision the state legislature be inserted.
they gave what was said in support of that amendment.
however, my lord, i think we can skip that and come to para 19, because eventually they hold that the original proposed article 341, was legislated.
para 19, this part of the constituent assembly debate, coupled with the fact that article 341, makes it clear that the state legislature or its executive, has no power of disturbing term used by dr. ambedkar, quote, the presidential list of scheduled castes for the state.
it is also clear that articles, in part 16 of the constitution, that power of the state to deal with the scheduled castes is totally absent, except to bear in mind the required maintenance of efficiency of administration, in making of appointments which is found in article 335, therefore,...
my lord, this is the finding. therefore, any executive action or legislative enactment which interferes, disturbs, rearranges, regroups or reclassifies the various castes, found in the presidential list will be violative of the scheme of the constitution and will be violative of article 341, of the constitution, completely per incuriam 16(4).
then my lord they say, we will now consider whether the scheduled caste list, prepared by the president under 341, forms one class of homogeneous group or does it still continue to be a list consisting of different castes, subcastes and tribes etc,.
we have earlier noticed the fact that the constitution has provided for only one list of scheduled castes to be prepared by the president, with a limited power of inclusion and exclusion by the president.
the constitution intended that all castes included in the set schedule would be deemed to be, they say, deemed to be, one class of persons.
that is nowhere in 341, but arguments have been addressed to the contrary, stating that in spite of the presidential list, these castes continue to hold their birth mark and remain to be separated and individual castes, though put in one list by the president.
it is contention of the respondents, that by merely including them in the list, by the president, these castes do not become a homogeneous group.
therefore, to fulfil the constitutional obligation of providing an opportunity to these castes, more so, to the weaker among them, it is permissible to make classification within the class, as was made permissible in this regard to other backward classes by the court in the case of indra sawhney.
we cannot accept this argument, for more than one reasons.
then the second finding comes my lord, it cannot be denied, that all castes included in the presidential list for a state, are deemed to be scheduled caste, which means they form a class by themselves.
so, my lord, here that age old argument, and an example comes of a fruit chaat and jam.
if the intention of the legislature was make it into a jam once they come into the class, then inclusion, exclusion becomes, otiose.
that means, after it becomes a jam, you can't take out the apple from it, and leave the peach inside.
but if the option has been given to the parliament to keep one and take out the other, it remains a fruit chaat and not a jam.
but the court proceeded to make it that once they come in, they all merge into one, birthmarks are lost.
which in my humble submission is erroneous interpretation of 341.
then my lord, krishna iyer speaking in the same case, with reference to the status of castes included in the presidential list, had this to say, "we may clear the clog of article 16(2), as it stems from a confusion about caste and terminology of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes".
this latter expression has been defined in article 341 and 342.
a bear reading brings out the quintessential concept, that they as i see there, are no caste in hindu fold, but an amalgam of caste, race, group, tribes, communities or part thereof, found on investigation to be the lowliest and in need of massive state aid and notified as such by the president.
then my lord, they interpret this comment in paragraph 24, according to justice krishna iyer, though there are no castes, races, groups, tribes, communities or part thereof in hinduism, the president on investigation, having found some of the communities within the amalgam, as being lowliest and in need of massive state aid included them in one class, called the scheduled castes.
the sequitur thereof is, that scheduled caste are one class for the purposes of constitution.
now, instead of recognizing, my lord, that it's a list of different caste groups, parts of groups.
they say once you come in, you become a part of a list, that list becomes the homogeneous class.
your contention would be that merely because of their inclusion in the scheduled castes list, they don't...
their birthmark is not removed. absolutely. that still remains.
that birthmark will remain because that is the birthmark, by which you will eventually be excluded by the parliament, or, the benefits to be granted under 16(4), will be to a certain group or groups within that cast.
you cannot say that today you are adharmi.
the moment you come in the list my lord, this would be a misnomer, because that is how the society stands it.
the moment you come in, the list, you cease being an adharmi, you become a scheduled caste, can't be.
there is nothing called as just a scheduled caste.
it's only the inclusion in the schedule, which makes it in common parlance to be called a scheduled caste, otherwise there is no caste, known as a scheduled caste.
yes. then my lord, 26. thus, from the scheme of the constitution, article 341 and above, opinions of this court in n. m. thomas, it is clear, that castes once included in the president list, form a class by themselves, if they are one class under the constitution, any division...
any division of these classes of persons based on any consideration would amount to tinkering with the presidential list.
my lord, i'll resume. about how long, mr. advocate general now, after this?
we'll take an hour and a half.
an hour and a half? this is the first judgment.
the only thing is, my lord, once i read those judgments maybe the repetitive content will not be necessary to be read.
i am not going into the my lord '63 '64 judgments, because everything has eventually crystallised into five judgments.
so, this being the first, it will take a little while.
i'll try to finish today. you need not go to the pre n.m thomas judgement.
that's right. n. m. thomas being very important thereafter akhil bhartiya and indra sawhney.
indra sawhney really is one. we'll have to see that, because eventually what the law has come to be, is that what is good for backward classes is good for the scheduled castes.
so therefore, that connection may have said.
well, indra sawhney was cited in chinnaiah.
but they said, well, that is only for obcs.
and not for... that's right, that is the wrong interpretation because it is not.
indra sawhney itself makes it clear that we are only putting aside the schedule castes argument because we're not dealing with it.
we need to just look at that part..
those paragraphs. yes. the reference order, in fact, sums up all of this.
yes they are, in fact, extracted the relevant parts of the...
grateful, my lords. come back after lunch.
which is the judgment you want us to see?
i was on chinnaiah my lord, which is volume v, fifth bookmark.
yes, we got it. the theme is the same actually, that, they say that, "sub-classification which is committed in indra sawhney for obcs is not permissible for scs. because they say it's one homogeneous class." that's right.
"and therefore, once parliament has designated certain castes or tribes or races as scheduled castes, you cannot further sub-group sub classify." they use that expression, right?
'sub-divide, sub-classify or sub-group.' that's the theory, really.
one is that. and your contention is that parliament's power to designate is very different from the state's power to implement reservations under 16(4).
and they have not done and therefore had due regard to the ambit of article 16 (4), i think that is your submission.
that's the issue of identification, and this is the issue of implementation.
implementation. that's right. they have not considered the interplay between 16(4) and 341.
that's right. none at all. in fact, argued by mr. venugopal, but not considered at all.
so, article 341 is all about? identification.
the identification. identification/inclusion and exclusion of caste.
inclusion and exclusion. while 16(4) is conferring of benefits on those who are not adequately represented in services.
which paragraph were you on? i was on 26.
i just read 26 before they.... yes, there is 31 also.
31 says, "sub-classification is beyond legislative competence under entry 41 of list 2 and entry 25 of list 3." then para 38, they say, "subclassification, which is permitted in indra sawhney for obcs is not permissible for scs, who form one class." that's para 31.
indra sawhney does not say so. i'll come to that in a bit.
we'll go directly thereafter to indra sawhney, because...
and then... correct. that's right, my lord, because....
.... in para 39 and 41, they say....
so, the whole theme is, this is one homogeneous group, you cannot....
yes. the second question, which they frame in 27.
i will just frame that? yes. which is on judicial...
sorry. on legislative competence. competence, yes. and they answer that in para.
31, page 798. that's right. without examining 16, though.
if your lordship would have... yes. 31 my lord.
last 10 lines are relevant. "it is the prerogative of the concerned state." my lords have it?
bottom of page 794. placitum e? yes that's right.
may i my lord? it is the prerogative of the state concerned, if it so desires, with an object of providing opportunity of advancement in the society to certain backward classes, which includes the scheduled caste to reserve certain seats in educational institutions under 15(4) and in public services of the state under 16(4).
that part of its constitutional obligation, as stated, has already been fulfilled by the state.
my lord now, this is a very interesting part, my lord.
they call this a one-time exercise, which i could not my lord conceive how.
but they say once you've provided reservation, you've done what you had to do.
so if i read it further, my lord, having done so it is not open to the state to sub classify a class already recognized by the constitution and allot a portion of the already reserved quota amongst the state created sub-class within the list of scheduled castes.
from the discussion here and above, it is clear that primary object of the impugned enactment is to create groups of sub-castes in the list of scheduled castes, applicable to the state and in our opinion apportionment meant of reservation is only secondary and consequential.
so they say the primary objective is creating a sub-class while.....
totally the state may also feel that look, backward classes as a whole are represented in the state adequately but within the component of backward classes there are some communities who have no representation at all and therefore that skewed distribution of benefits has to be corrected.
and my lords it is no synonymous.
it is not synonymous that every backward class would be a scheduled caste.
right. can't be. some of them may be socially and educationally backward classes.
some of them maybe socially and educationally backward classes.
yes, so if i from from amongst the backward classes those which, in your opinion, you want to confer the benefit on, it's as simple as that.
what they seem to suggest is if you are giving reservations to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, you must take them as one composite whole.
that's right. that seems to be the logic of the judgment.
the entirety of the judgment is this really.
that once they've been included in the list you cannot...
then either take it or leave it as it is.
yes, either take the whole. you decide not to give reservations at all.
but if you give, you must give to everybody.
to everyone in equal proportion. that seems to be the intent.
not equal proportion. equality. no. they say you cannot apportion reservation.
that is everybody must have a bite at the entirety of the issue.
entirety of the issue. it should be either 100% or zero.
it should go as per merit among that category.
i bow my lord. that is it.
that is right. then my lord they say whatever be the object of this sub-classification and apportionment of reservation, we think now my lord this is where the my lord interpretation of only 41 and 25 kindly my lord may take note.
we think that the state cannot claim legislative power to make a law dividing the scheduled caste list of the state by tracing its legislative competence to entry 41 of list 2 or entry 25 of list 3.
therefore, we are of the opinion that in pith and substance, the enactment is not a law governing the field of education or the field of state public services.
here 16(4) should have found its part.
they say that power is being traced, only to entries.
i think we've dealt enough with this.
now let's go straight to indra sawhney, i think because....
my lords, your lordships have seen question 3 my lord, para 32 and 33.
32 and 33. 32, they frame the next classifications....
they follow triloki nath khosa, that micro classification.
yes. there they consider a very important issue that is it violative of 14.
they say that whether it would stand the test of article 14.
then my lord, considering khosa's judgment. there actually khosa, if you see page 416, what happened was placitum b. that's right.
if in this case the government had prescribed that only those degree holders who had secured over 70% marks could become chief engineers, and those with 60% alone would become be eligible by the scs or that foreign degrees would be preferred.
we would have analytically avoided it. i think there what happened was that they were going by the birthmarks and the argument of...
the finding of our court is once you enter service, whether you are a director to, whether you are a diploma holder or a degree holder.
once you enter service then your birthmarks are ....
then you become a member of the service.
then you will be governed by the rules under 309.
if you were a dsp, for promotion to sp, it doesn't matter how you came.
you have to compete with the others and get through your quota.
if there is for direct recruitment or promotion, it will govern you.
your lordships are absolutely right. they answer this, if your lordships would only have one line.
the third question in para 37. we have already held that the members of schedule caste form a class by themselves and any further classification would be impermissible while applying the principle of reservation.
then my lord, indra sawhney's finding comes in para 38.
on behalf of the respondents. that we need not.
go straight to indra sawhney. i will go straight to indra sawhney.
i will show that indra sawhney never decided that in schedule caste, sub-classification should not be done.
then more backwardness, end of para 41.
the only thing is, we may read only one sentence there, placitum d. because that very judgment itself is specifically held that subdivision of other backward classes is not applicable to scheduled caste and scheduled tribes.
it has not. that is what i will show.
that is what i'll show. for other purposes it has deliberated, but for this purpose it has never held it.
para 41 your lordships have seen. class as a whole.
that's right where last five lines they say that...
leave it there. i think it is the same now.
same thing. justice sema's judgment is on the same lines below, then justice sinha's judgment concurring.
mr. advocate, as mr. sankaranarayanan said in the morning, the reference order penned by justice arun mishra...
that's right. ... contains now an elaborate extraction of all the judgments in indra sawhney.
so maybe we can go directly to the reference orders.
so, we'll find everything at one place.
everything would be there. we don't flip pages then.
my lord, in indra sawhney, it was a judgment where justice b.p. jeevan reddy has given the majority opinion.
so that majority opinion, on behalf of him and four other judges.
that we'll just need to see the gist of it as to what exactly have they held.
all right. so then, i'll skip this judgment.
your lordships can have a look at it.
you have not dealt with this judgement.
where is indra sawhney? do you want to go?
yes, my lord. indra sawhney is a part of this compilation.
or justice arun mishra's judgement, whatever. the original.
volume v, page? my lord, it starts at page 190, pdf 194.
let me just say at the outset my lord, the exceptions which they talk of are only on two issues.
one is on presumption of backwardness, which they opine on, and then creamy layer.
these two your lordships may note. they do not opine on sub-classification.
we can come to page 688, pdf 692.
yeah. para 780. identification of backward class of citizens.
which page is that? this is the placitum e, page 692 pdf, internal page 715 of the judgment in scc.
para starts with now we may turn.
yes. now we may turn to the identification of backward class of citizens.
how do you go about it? where do you begin?
is the method to vary from state to state, region to region, from rural to urban?
what do you do in case of religions, where caste system is not prevailing?
what about other classes, groups and communities which do not wear the label of caste?
are the people living adjacent to ceasefire line in jammu and kashmir or hilly or inaccessible regions to be surveyed and identified as backward classes for the purpose of article 16(4)?
and so on and so forth are many questions asked of us.
we shall answer them, but our answers will necessarily deal with generalities of the situation and not with problems or issues of peripheral nature which are peculiar to the particular state, region or district.
each and every situation cannot be visualized and answered.
that we must leave to the appropriate authorities appointed to identify.
we can only lay down general guidelines.
then 781. "at the outset, we may state that, for the purposes of this discussion,... now, my lords, for the purposes of 'identification', we keep aside the scheduled tribes and scheduled caste (since they are admittedly included within the backward classes), except to remark that backward classes contemplated by 16(4) do comprise some castes, for it cannot be denied that scheduled castes include quite a few castes. so, for the purposes of identification, they keep aside scheduled caste, saying that, "there is a presumption of backwardness with the scheduled caste.
we are not going into it. " then para 782 would be slightly relevant. "coming to the question of identification, the fact remains that one has to begin somewhere with some group, class or section.
there is no set or recognized method.
there is no law or other statutory instrument prescribing the methodology.
the ultimate idea is to survey the entire populace.
if so, one can well begin with caste, which represent explicit, identifiable social classes/groupings, more particularly when 16(4) seeks to ameliorate social backwardness.
what is unconstitutional with it, more so when caste, occupation, poverty and social backwardness are so closely intertwined in our society.
individual survey's out of the question since article 16(4) speaks of class protection and not individual protection.
this does not mean that one can wind up the process of identification with the castes, besides, caste, whether found amongst hindus or others.
there may be other communities, groups and classes and denomination, which may qualify as backward class of citizens.
" so my lord, they have pretty much carved out, my lord. then the religious denominations like muslims, sikhs who do not follow the caste system. and that, my lord, if your lordships would have seen, in the order, issued by the president is an exception under clause 3, that, "this will not apply to sikhs, muslims.
" i'd shown that to your lordships, from the order. now, the second exception, my lord, is just below in para 792 my lord. it starts from running page 695, para 790, pdf 699. para 792? para 790. " means, test and creamy layer.
" that is the heading of the discussion, sub-clause (d). "means test in this discussion...
" my lords have it? " ....
signifies imposition of an income limit for the purpose of excluding persons from backward class, whose income is above the said limit.
" this submission is very often referred to as, 'the creamy layer argument.' petitioners submit that, "some members of the designated backward classes are highly advanced socially, as well as economically and educationally.
" so, my lord, they are talking about, "what is the creamy layer principle.
" and in 792 on page 697, i'll read my lord, the umbilical cord argument my lord. in our opinion it is not a question of permissibility or desirability of such tests but one of proper and more appropriate identification of a class, a backward class. the very concept of a class denotes a number of persons having certain common traits which distinguish them from others. in a backward class under clause 4 of article 16 if the connecting link is the social backwardness, it should broadly be the same in a given class. if some of the members are far too advanced socially, which in the context necessarily means economically and may also mean educationally, then the connecting thread between them and the remaining class snaps. the connecting thread between, they would be misfits in the class. after excluding them alone would the class be a compact class. in fact such, excluding them alone exclusion..... sorry. such exclusion benefits the truly backward. difficulty, however, lies in drawing the line. how and where to draw the line for while drawing the line it should be ensured that it does not result in taking away with one hand what it gives by the other. the basis of exclusion should not be merely economic, unless, of course, the economic advancement is so high that it necessarily means social advancement. let us illustrate the point. a member of backward class say a member of a carpenter class goes to middle east and works there as a carpenter. if you take his annual income in rupees, it would be fairly high from the indian standard. is he to be excluded from the backward class? are his children in india to be deprived of the benefit of 16(4)? situation may, however, be different if he rises so high economically as to become, say, a factory owner himself. in such a situation his social status also rises. he himself would be in a position to provide employment to others. so my lord, they are going on a very subjective satisfaction of at which stage the chord between backwardness and the individual breaks. now my lord, i'll straightaway go to the last ten lines of this paragraph, where the individual argument ends. it starts with it is then argued for the respondent. placitum b on page 698. my i my lord, it is then argued. it is then argued for the respondents that one swallow does not make the summer, and that merely because a few members of the caste or class become socially advanced, the class or caste as such does not cease to be backward. it is pointed out that clause 4 of article 16 aims at group backwardness and not individual backwardness. while we agree that socially advanced members will make a class a truly backward class and would more appropriately serve the purpose and object of clause 4, this discussion, my lord may kindly note this. this discussion is confined to other backward classes only and has no relevance in the case of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes. so this discussion is on creamy layer. whether the individual income or the income of the class as a whole and the parameters and factors which would define as to whether the cord and the thread between the class and the individual and its backwardness has snapped or not. so these are the only two parameters where they exclude the discussion on scheduled castes. otherwise, indra sawhney nowhere excludes scheduled caste for the purposes of sub-classification. so my lord in fact, if your lordship would see on sub-classification they positively my lord, if your lordship would come straight away to 801 my lord, the question number 5. it is answered on page 702. pdf 706, where the question is framed, whether backward classes can be further divided into backward and more backward categories. my lords have it? yes. and this backward includes sc/st because they say in balaji, it was held that subclassification made by order between backward classes and more backward classes does not appear to be justified under article 15(4). article 15(4) authorizes special provisions being made for the really backward classes in introducing two categories of backward classes what the impugned order in substance purports to do, is to devise measures for the benefit of all the classes of citizens who are less advanced compared to the most advanced classes in the state, and that, in our opinion, is not the scope of 15(4). the result of method adopted by the impugned order is that nearly 90% of the population of the state is treated as backward. and that illustrates how the order, in fact, divides the population of the state into most advanced and the rest and puts latter into two categories of backward and more backward. the classification of the two categories, therefore is not warranted by article 15(4). my lord, this is quote from balaji. then they hold, the correctness of this holding is questioned before us by the counsel for the respondents. it is submitted that in principle, there is no justification for the said holding. it is submitted that even among backward classes, there are some who are more backward than the others and that the backwardness is not and cannot be uniform throughout the country, nor even within the state. in support of this contention, the respondents rely upon observation of chinnapa reddy j. in vasanth kumar, where the learned judge said we do not see why on principle, there cannot be classification into backward classes and more backward classes. if both class classes are not merely a little behind, but far behind the most advanced classes. in fact, such a classification would necessarily help the more backward classes. otherwise, those of the backward classes who might be a little more advanced than the more backward classes might walk away with all the seats. then in para 802, they say we are of the opinion that there is no constitutional or legal bar. this was a specific question which fell from your lordships. to the state, categorizing the backward classes as backward and more backward. we are not saying that it ought to be done. we are concerned with the question if the state makes such categorization, whether it would be invalid, we think not. then they give the example of mandal commission, which may not be so relevant because here they are comparing two castes like in andhra pradesh my lord. they are comparing goldsmiths and vaddes, which who has stone cutters, to be a part of the backward class but goldsmiths will always be more affluent than the stone cutters. so there if a distinguishing factor is made between both of these, there is a rationale which is supported. basically, my lord, the issue is that that exercise, as and when done, has to be taken to be whether it is done with the object sought to be achieved in mind, whether it is a reasonable classification or not. now, 803 my lords, may have. there is another way of looking at this issue. article 16(4) recognizes only one class which backward class of citizens does not speak separately of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes, as does article 15(4). even so, it is beyond controversy that scheduled caste and scheduled tribes are also included in the expression backward class of citizens and that separate reservations can be provided in their favour. it is well accepted phenomena throughout the country. what is the logic behind it? it is that if scheduled caste and scheduled tribes and other backward classes are lumped together, obcs will take away all the vacancies, leaving scheduled caste and schedule tribes high and dry. the same logic also warrants categorization as between the more backward and backward. we do not mean to say, we may reiterate, that this should be done... there is a little confusion over here. does that really apply to the sub-classification of the scheduled caste and tribes? or is it really referring to the sub-classification of the obcs, other than the..... my submission would be 'both'. because, as your lordships correctly said... i don't know, actually, whether that ... that may not be a correct reading of indira sawhney, actually. my lords, in fact said that, "what is the logic?
" if you choose.... indra sawhney would only be for reservation of obcs is only for consideration. the issue was with regard to the reservation of obcs. that's right. that's why we say right up front, that we are leaving aside the issue of sc and st. they leave that aside only on two issues, creamy layer and identification of backwardness. when they discuss backward within the backward, they do not say, "we are not talking about schedule castes.
" it appears with that whole discussion was in the context of the socially and educationally backward classes. so they are obcs, really. my lord, 'whether or not it's a positive mandate', i leave it to your lordships to decide. because, this judgment would most certainly be binding upon all of us. the only thing is, 'there is no bar.' they clearly and categorically say... that's separate argument altogether. but to say that, "this expressly recognizes that there can be sub-classification among scheduled castes, may not be...
that was not the issue, really, that they dealt with.
not really. but it recognizes the logic.
if there is a gap between the disadvantaged and the most disadvantaged, it's a reason enough for classification.
that is a rational criteria. that's what indra sawhney holds, that 'backward and more backward' is a rational criteria.
and it is permissible in law? it's permissible in law.
also, nothing in law bars it. nothing in law prohibits it.
so, if the state.... that is what i said in the beginning.
there's no mandate to do it, but if the state chooses to do it, there's nothing against it.
question is already answered here. 'what remains?' end of the matter.
that's right. nine judges have decided. yeah, finally.
then we can straight away come to nagaraj, my lords, because that is, my lord, a judgment, which is very clear in category and an emphatic reiteration of the principle.
this is also in volume v. page 23, my lord.
pdf page? 27. of the same volume?
that's right. justice . this was a seven judge bench, which was considering....
20? that is thomas? yes, thomas, my lord, (1976) 2 scc.
you want to go through a paragraph?
just a couple of paragraphs which are relevant.
because, otherwise it reiterates the issue. because it talks specifically of 16(1) and 16(4) interplay, my lords.
my lord, may just come straight away to para 24 to 28 my lord.
high court here has decided only on the basis non-suited you or really held against you only on the basis of chinnaiah.
quite right. so if we come to the conclusion, of course we're here to hear the other side that chinnaiah has wrongly decided.
you still have to go to the high court for any other challenges.
right? any other challenges which are there to this statute.
otherwise, we will be deciding issues like adequate representation, whatever other, whatever other challenges there are.
my lord what i can also suggest is that once your lordships set aside that judgment on the basis that chinnaiah itself is set aside.
we can set this with three judges.
and leave the question of law open my lord.
if somebody challenges in a fresh litigation, we will deal with it my lord.
but you know what were the challenges there before the high court?
primarily this my lord, that there's a five judge bench which has got to be there.
other than that, there was no other ground.
no fresh grounds were taken to challenge.
no ground for judicial review of that.
grounds were same which were otherwise reiterated in chinnaiah.
the original petitioners before the high court are represented here?
yes. yes. so we'll see what is the nature of their challenge.
yes. if chinnaiah was fundamentally on the basis of the petition, then we can conclude it here, one way or the other after hearing.
that's what i'm saying. and then if somebody else wants to challenge it, file a repetition there, why should we.....
my lords may grant them the liberty if any additional issues arise other than chinnaiah.
i'm sure my lord there's no bar in challenging them, because that would be a fresh challenge.
unless they say they have raised other valid challenges which were not adjudicated, then we have to restore the petition there.
for which they would want to revive their petition.
yes, that's right. because one thing is clear, the high court has gone only on that.
that's right. the other way is that we restore it to a two judge bench, two judge bench will decide all the other questions.
but they do that, whoever. one person loses a right of appeal then.
go back to the high court. you have not knowledge with regard to quantifiable data and all that?
no, not to my knowledge. they can't be because there in punjab, the scheduled caste are 38% and the reservation is only 25%.
so, there can't be quantifiable data to that extent.
why? that is in the statute. 25% in direct recruitment.
no, there would be data at two levels.
one, are the scheduled castes, as a group in punjab adequately represented in the services of the state.
that's one. two, within the group of scheduled castes, is there a, not proportionate, but is there a fair representation to the mazhabi sikhs and balmikis?
government will have data on that. they would have collected data.
obviously, without that, they won't have my lord, if population  is there, that has to be 38%.
27 departments  from across the government and we put that data in a compiled shimmer showing their miserably inadequacy they means who some departments.
they means who? the mazhabis. some departments, not a single person, since the time the department was created.
we put that what is the population ratio?
39%. amongst the scheduled caste? yes, my lord.
amongst the scheduled caste, they constitute 39%?
yes sir and yet they represent very, very miniscule, and the post they occupy are of scavengers.
that's the kind of disparities. what is the total representation of schedule caste in punjab?
25% is the limit. of total population?
38%, my lord. 25% or 38%? 38%.
there is no scheduled tribe there my lord.
they are 33%. 33%. and the mazhabi sikhs and the balmiki constitute about?
39% of the 33%. 33%of the 39%.
although there are 39 castes mentioned, i've given the data from government records.
some of these castes are only 30 people, 70 people, 100 people, 200.
so although these are two castes, but they represent 39%.
and on the other side two or three castes represent a much larger number, represent about 43% people, but they are occupying 81% of the course.
they are the main people who are left out, who the other side represent.
we will give that data. we can place that.
we're not going to that question. actually this doesn't arise.
we are dealing with... it's a bench of seven judges.
we are dealing with the validity of the decision or the correctness of decisions of chinnaiah.
that's what i was admitting my lord.
we will not go beyond that. mr. manu swaroop, we shouldn't be going into things which are not argued by the high court and the subject matter reference by 3 only out of curiosity, we ask.
generally, we ask. rest assured, we will not rest our decision on that at all.
i will just ventilate one indication to your lordships.
there's a reason why the state did not go into the empirical advice.
i'm not going into that for the reason that other people may have different data, as they are volunteering.
but the state data is a 2020 data, of the year 2020.
their first notification came as your lordships observe in 1975, their act came in 2006.
they've put on record data of 2020, again unverified.
although there's a commission... constitutional commission... that will have to be argued at the appropriate...
what data was there when you passed the act because that will impact upon the reservations for that period between the act and 2020.
when they produce it basically on behalf of the state.
we're not going into that. one of the arguments which we would address also here, that the concept of creamy layer has no applicability here for the simple reason the difference between the scheduled caste and the downtrodden scheduled caste is not much.
the creamy, they are not far ahead that one is earning a little, one is earning rs. 10, other is earning rs. 5.
so whole proposition is a fallacy. that has not been accepted in jarnail.
justice nariman's judgement jarnail specifically doesn't argue.
the argument before that constitution bench was the concept of creamy layer has no application to the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe, and that has been rejected by...
that is not. that's the general proposition.
but when we come to the factual aspect, then we see what the scheduled caste is earning and what the down trodden schedule caste is earning, your lordships will say that they are not far ahead.
they have just... we can’t decide that at prior basis.
with that we would be arguing and supported by that, that under what circumstances the .....
that's all we have. mr. advocate general, now what more?
what next, now? please, my lord, i was in para 24, my lord, of thomas.
page 45, pdf 49. they're just short-short paragraphs, my lord, i'll quickly go through them.
"discrimination is the essence." my lords have it?
yes. para? justice ray's opinion. "discrimination is the essence of classification. equality is violated if it rests on unreasonable basis. the concept of equality has an inherent limitation, arising from the very nature of constitutional guarantee. those who are similarly circumstanced are entitled to an equal treatment. equality is amongst equals. classification is, therefore, to be founded on substantial differences which distinguished persons group together from those left out of the groups. and such differential attributes must bear a just and rational relation to the object sought to be achieved." so, my lord, further in para 31 on page 47, pdf 51, my lord.
here also they talk of 'equality amongst equals.' they say, "the rule of parity is the equal treatment of equals in equal circumstances. the rule of differentiation is enacting laws differentiating between different persons or things in different circumstances. the circumstances which govern one set of persons or objects may not necessarily be the same as those governing another set of persons or objects, so that the question of unequal treatment does not really arise between persons governed by different...." is not different.
equal treatments to unequal is a ...
that's right. my lord, that's settled law.
need not much labour on it. so, your lordships will come to para 44, my lord.
'about preference, my lord, pdf 54. 'our constitution.
' " our constitution aims at equality of status and opportunity for all citizens, including those who are socially, economically and educationally backward. the claims of members of backward classes require adequate representation in legislative and executive bodies. if members of scheduled caste and tribes who are said by this court to be backward classes can maintain minimum necessary requirement of administrative efficiency, not only representation, but also preference may be given to them to enforce equality and to eliminate inequality. article 15(4) and 16 (4) bring out the position of backward class to merit equality. special provisions are to be made for advancement of backward classes and reservations of appointment enforce for them to secure adequate representation. these probations will bring out the content of equality guaranteed by article 14, 15(1) and 16 (1). the basic concept of equality is, 'equality of opportunity for appointment, preferential treatment for members of backward classes with due regard to administrative efficiency alone can mean equality of opportunity for all citizens. equality under article 16 could not have a different context from equality under article 14. equality of opportunity for unequal can only mean aggravation of inequality. equality of opportunity admits discrimination with reason and prohibits discrimination without reason. discrimination with reason means rational classification for differential treatments having nexus to the constitutionally permissible object, preferential representation for backward classes and services with due regard to administrative efficiencies, permissible object and backward classes are a rational classification recognized by constitution. therefore, differential treatment in standards of selection are within the scope of equality." my lord, basically the judgment proceeds on this standard that, 'differentiation for the purposes of achieving the constitutional objective is permissible', which i am citing, my lord, to basically support my argument that, ' if, within the class....' unequal treatment to unequal.
yes. so, if there are unequal even within the backward classes....
to bring them equal. that's right. eventually.
my lord, if the government is holding the hands of people who are socially and economically backward.
there can absolutely be no adversarial claim of that very class holding the hand of people who are further downtrodden.
basically with the eventual idea of bringing everybody, if not equal but adequately represented.
that is the basic substance. then my lord the next judgment, we can come straight away to my lord, nagaraj pdf 1336 my lord pagination 1332.
1336 my lord pdf. here my lord the sub-classification was discussed and upheld, pertaining specifically to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, my lord the main judgment, justice kapadia's judgment, my lords may kindly have page 1398 straightaway my lord, pdf.
page? 1398 pdf my lord. here my lord indra sawhney as your lordships were wanting to clarify, that is discussed, as to on what purposes and what is the further interpretation given.
may i my lord? yes. in indra sawhney, the equality which was protected by the rule of 50% was by balancing the rights of general category vis-a-vis, the rights of bcs and block consisting of obc's, scs and sts.
on the other hand, in the present case, the question which we are required to answer is whether within the egalitarian equality indicated by article 16(4) the sub-classification in favour of scs and sts is a principle, constitutionally valid.
so this is specifically framed as a question.
article 16(4)(a) is inspired by the observations in indra sawhney vide paras 802 and 803, in which this court has unequivocally observed that in order to avoid lumping of obcs, scs and sts, which would make obcs take away all the vacancies, leaving scs and sts high and dry.
the state concerned was entitled to categorize and subclassify scs and sts on one hand, vis-a-vis obcs on the other hand.
my lord then 802 and 803 are reproduced.
then 115 my lords may have. therefore, while judging the width and ambit of 16(4)(a), we must ascertain whether sub-sub-classification is permissible under the constitution.
the sub-classification between obcs on one hand and scs and sts on the other is held to be constitutionally permissible in indra sawhney.
in the said judgment, it has been held that state could make such sub-classification with scs and sts vis-a-vis obcs.
it refers to subclassification within the egalitarian equality vide para 802 and 803.
therefore, article 16(4)(a) follows the line suggested by this court in indra sawhney.
in indra sawhney, on the other hand, vide para 829, this court has struck a balance between formal equality and egalitarian equality by laying down the rule of 50% ceiling limit for entire bcs as a class apart vis-a-vis gc.
therefore, in our view, equality as a concept is retained even under article 16(4)(a), which is carved out of article 16(4).
as stated above, article 14 enables classification.
a classification must be founded on intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from the others.
the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by law under challenge in indra sawhney and opinions was expressed by this court vide 802, that there is no constitutional or legal bar to making of classification under 16(4)(b) is also an enabling provision.
it seeks to make classification on the basis of differentia between current vacancies and carry forward vacancies.
in case of article 16(4)(b), we must keep in mind that following the judgment in r.k. sabharwal, the concept of post based roster is introduced.
consequently, specific slots for obcs, scs and sts, as well as gcs have to be maintained in the roster.
well then see therefore, by article, two lines below 16(4)(b) a classification is made between current vacancies on one hand and carry forward backlog basis is on the other.
article 16(4)(b) is a direct consequence of the judgment of this court in rk sabharwal, by which the concept of post based roster is introduced.
therefore, in our view, 16(4)(a) and 16(4)(b) form a composite part of the scheme envisaged.
therefore, in our view, article so and so together form a part of the same scheme.
as stated above. 16(4)(a) and 16(4)(b), both are inspired by observations of the supreme court in indra sawhney and r.k sabharwal.
they have nexus with article 17 and 46 of the constitution.
therefore, we uphold the classification envisaged by article 16(4)(a) and 16(4)(b).
the impugned constitutional amendments therefore, do not obliterate equality.
so my lord, here they've extended that principle of indra sawhney of bcs to scs and sts.
can i take your lordships to 16(4)(a)and (4)(b), just for the sake of reference?
kindly have the constitution my lord. 4(a) reads: nothing in this article shall prevent the state from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion with consequential seniority to any class or classes of posts and services under the state in favour of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes, which in the opinion of the state are not adequately represented in the services under the state.
so, my lord, here specifically the state is endowed with the power.
to make reservations. to make reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, which, in the opinion of the state are not adequately represented, not backward classes, even within the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe.
that are not adequately represented. therefore quantifiable data.
so therefore in schedule caste also, there may be some which are adequately represented, some which may not be totally adequately represented, so they can be carved out under 4(a) and then under consequential seniority under 4(b).
which other judgment? are we done? yes.
nagraj is done. my lord. we can come straightaway to davinder now, which your lordship was saying, is the letter reference order.
this is arun mishra? yes, which is 2010.
which page? page 1400, pdf... 1404, 2028 scc, page 1.
that's right. now you've taken us through the basic judgment.
you don't have to go through the reference.
i think this discusses everything in detail.
i'll just come to the relevant parts of it.
it basically extracts all the judgment. we come straight away to my lord, page 1416, which is 1420 pdf.
1420, pdf running 1416. the opinion of justice arun mishra, this was a unanimous verdict.
it's authored by him. a bench of three judges.
may i my lord? bench of 5.
5. this is 5. reference by 3.
that's right, my lord, reference by 3.
decided by 5. that's right. it's not a simpliciter reference, your lordships had correctly put, it gives details as to, 'why they feel that chinnaiah needs to be reconsidered...' but it answers all those 3 questions.
yes, that's right. they made the.... recorded all your arguments here.
exactly, my lord. held in your favour.
that benefit i surely had, my lord.
para 2, they framed the questions. see para 35, at page 1458.
before that, it's basically quotations. then, have your lordship, seen paras 7, my lord?
where these submissions are noted, and then the conclusions.
or we can come straight away to the findings.
yeah, we can go straight to the findings.
first sentence of the para 35, they formulate the question.
'whether it amounts to an inclusion or exclusion sub-classification?' that's right.
in fact, my lord, a reference is made to justice sinha's opinion from chinnaiah, in paragraph 20, page 1431 pdf, my lord.
if your lordships could just have that.
yeah, mr. sankaranarayanan, you're right. it's para 43, placitum d. they say that, "preferential treatment would not tantamount to excluding other classes as total deprivation caused to any of the castes in the list of scheduled caste. it is a case of classification to provide benefit to all and to those deprived the benefit of reservation being the poorest to the poor." thay say, here is the question, " whether the action based on intelligible differentia to trickle down the benefits can be said to be violative of articles 14 and 16? and whether sub-classification can be said to be an act of inclusion or exclusion? particularly when various reports indicate that there is inequality inter se various castes, including the list of scheduled castes. they do not constitute homogeneous class have been relied upon." in fact, my lord, in this, they opined that jarnail singh lays down the fact that, 'creamy layer is applicable to sc, st', in para.
27. if your lordships.... after discussing ashok kumar....
then they say in para 44 again....
44 at page 1462. "the caste of group or sub-group continued exactly as before in the list. it is only those persons within that group or sub-group who have come out of the untouchability of backwardness by virtue of belonging to the creamy layer, who are excluded from the benefit of reservation. a million dollar question is, "how to trickle down the benefit to the bottom rung?
" reports indicate that benefit is being usurped by those castes, class who have come up inadequately represented. here, caste, occupational poverty are inter-govern. state cannot be deprived of the power to take care of the qualitative and quantitative differences between different classes to make ameliorative measures." para 46, also, your lordships may have.
there is a cry. yes, para 46 bhi important hai.
para 46, there is a cry and caste struggle within the reserved class, as benefit of reservation in services and education is being enjoyed, who are doing better hereditary occupation, the scavenger class, given the name of balmikis, remains more or less where it was, and so on disparity between schedule caste is writ large from various reports.
the sub-classification was made under section 4 sub clause 5 of the punjab act to ensure that benefit of the reservation percolate down to the deprived section and do not remain on paper and to provide benefit to all and give them equal treatment, whether it is violative of article 14, in our opinion, it would be permissible on rational basis to make such sub-classification, to provide benefit to all, to bring equality and it would not amount to exclusion from the list, as no class/cast is deprived of reservation in totality.
in case the benefit which is meant for the emancipation of all the castes included in the list of scheduled castes is permitted to be usurped by few castes who are adequately represented, have advanced and belong to the creamy layer, then it would tantamount to creating inequality.
whereas in case of hungry, every person is required to be fed and provided bread.
the entire basket of fruits cannot be given to the mighty at the cost of the others under the guise of forming a homogeneous class.
the constitution is an effective tool of social reformation.
removal of inequalities intends to wipe off tears from every eye.
the social realities cannot be ignored and overlooked while the constitution aims at comprehensive removal of disparities.
the very purpose of providing reservation is to take care of disparities.
the constitution takes care of inequalities. there are unequals within the list of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and socially and educationally backward classes.
various reports indicate that scheduled castes and scheduled tribes do not constitute a homogeneous group.
the aspiration of equal treatment of the lowest strata, to whom the fruits of reservation have not effectively reached remains a dream.
at the same time, various castes by large remain where they were and they remain unequals, are they destined to carry their backwardness till eternity?
then they answer it in 48 and 49.
the state's obligation is to undertake the emancipation of deprived section of community and eradicate inequalities when the reservation creates inequalities within the reserved class itself it is required to be taken care of by the same.
it's okay. you can leave that i think.
thank you, mr. attorney general, i think we are wrapped up now.
please, my lord. i think that's more or less.
thank you so much. grateful. mr. farasat.
what ground are you going to cover now?
i have my lords, three submissions. i'll just formulate them and then i'll go straight into them also.
the first submission is that chinnaiah has certain internal contradictions because it's proceeded on the basis that article 341 is solely for the purpose of reservations alone.
no, it's for the purposes of this constitution.
that's correct. so my lords, the way chinnaiah proceeds, absolutely.
i'm so grateful to my lord the chief justice, the way chinnaiah proceeds, it in fact, says that....
alright. you can formulate and then. ...
yeah, so that's the first formulation. my lord the second submission is that article 342 a has now been introduced in the constitution and that has been introduced in the constitution and that read with your lordship's judgment in jaishri patil completely negates the fundamental logic of chinnaiah.
and my lords the third submission is that insofar as efficiency in service, that is, article 335 is concerned that is something when read in the context of constitution in fact, supports subclassification.
it does not negate subclassification because chinnaiah.
please repeat. article 335, the requirement of efficiency in administration of the government mandates or requires sub-classification.
before i go into each of the points, if i may submit, there are broadly two approaches your lordships have followed.
this is at the risk of slight over-simplification in matters of reservation.
one is, if i may articulate it, the cautious approach where the court is primarily concerned with preventing misuse of reservation, ensuring that it goes to the right people ensuring that hopefully, in a certain amount of time, it comes to an end.
the order, in reference with the learned advocate general just read, is in my respectful submission example of that approach.
and there is another approach, which is the deepening approach, which is the court is primarily concerned with how to deepen the impact of reservation to all the groups and that is the primary concern which the court is really concerned with.
my respectful submission is that the question of sub classification within scheduled castes and schedule tribes, irrespective of which of the approaches the court takes leads to the same conclusion.
that is the first approach. you say?
i said it's a cautious approach. whether court is more concerned with the formal mechanisms of reservation and preventing its misuse.
in the second, the court's emphasis is more on deepening the impact of reservation.
if i may say, the chief justice's judgement in pavitra is the example of the deepening approach and my submission is that, irrespective of which of those two approaches the court takes, both of them lead to the same conclusion, that is, sub-classification is not just constitutional, but possibly desirable and necessary.
second, it is clear that the principles which apply in the context of reservation versus non-reservation can be mirrored in the context of sub-classification within scheduled caste.
no doubt about it, one of the same principles can be mirrored.
like my lord, the chief justice pointed out in the morning.
however, in my submission with one difference, and that is that when we are dealing with scheduled caste, we are dealing with the weak and the weaker.
there is no forward group. that distinction is of some essence because this subclassification, either in the way we formulate our submissions, or the legislature or the court engages should not be used to beat the parent category of scheduled caste itself, that is also essential.
so really, we are discussing not a forward, backward or more forward and backward within backward.
we are discussing weak and weaker. so with that distinction i will just broadly go into my first submission.
your lordships will straight away have chinnaiah para 41 and that is internal page 418, volume v and running page 798, volume v, pdf page 802, begins at 801 bottom.
this is justice hegde speaking for the majority.
the conglomeration of caste given in the presidential order, in our opinion, should be considered representing a class as a whole, the contrary...
para? para 41 my lords. pdf 801 pdf 801.
otherwise it is 797. that's right. i'm grateful.
the conglomeration of caste given in its presidential order, in our opinion, should be considered as representing a class as a whole.
the contrary approach of the high court, in our opinion, was not correct.
the very fact that a legal fiction has been created is itself a justice of the fact that a legislature of a state cannot take any action which would be contrary to our inconsistent therewith the very idea of placing different caste or tribes of groups or parts thereof in a state as a conglomeration by way of a deeming definition clearly suggests that they are not to be subdivided or subclassified further.
if a class within a class of member or a scheduled caste is created, the same would amount to tinkering with the list such sub-classification would be violative of 14 of the constitution.
it may be true, as has been observed by the high court, that the caste system has got stuck up in the society, but with a view to do away with the evil effect thereof, a legislation which does not answer the constitutional, cannot be upheld.
it is also difficult to agree with the high court that for the purpose of identifying backwardness, a further inquiry can be made by appointing a commission as to, 'who amongst the members of scheduled castes is more backward?" now, this is important. "if benefits of reservation are not percolating to them equitably, measure should be taken to see that they are given such adequate or additional training, so as to enable them to compete with the others, but the same would not mean that in the process of rationalizing the reservation to the scheduled castes, the constitutional mandate of 14, 15 and 16 be violated." so, what the court is suggesting, and this becomes more explicit in justice sinha's opinion, which i'll just read now, is that, "you can take other measures for them. but not reservation." that is the suggestion.
and my lords, that will become explicit.
your lordships will now have para 114, which is at page 819 pdf.
890? 8-1-9 my lords. para. 114. it begins under the heading, 'what is the remedy?' so, my lord, after holding it to be unconstitutional...
page? 819. what is the remedy? that's right.
"there is one practical aspect of the matter which we may not also be lost sight of. the chart of... chart produced before us clearly shows that the members belonging to relli and adi-andhra are hardly educated. what are necessary in the situation was to provide to them scholarship, hostel facilities, special coaching, etc. so that they may be brought on the same platform in the members of the other scheduled tribes, namely madiga and mala, if not with the obcs. it is not in dispute that the members belonging to relli are hardly educated. only 2% of members of the said community have studied in secondary school." and then there is some discussion.
et cetera. so what the court is suggesting as a remedy is that, "you give other forms of affirmative action only to the sub category." that, in my respectful submission is a contradiction in terms of interpretation of 341 itself.
because 341 is 'scheduled caste for the purposes of this constitution. it doesn't say for the purposes of reservation alone.
' so, my submission is in their imagination.
the court, the chinnaiah court has assumed, that 341 is really for reservation.
you can do these other things, which will not hit 341.
but in fact, those very things which the court suggest will equally be hit by the interpretation of 341.
in fact, they are supporting your argument here.
in a way, yes, my lord. so, what i'm really saying is that, "if what the court suggests is possible." and...
identify them and accordingly dealt with it.
correct. so, my lord..... the position that they are more backward among the backwards.
yes, correct. so factually, they concede... the court says that factually the problem exists, and it says....
but, reservation is not the remedy. reservation is not the constitutional remedy, because it's not permissible on account of my interpretation of 341.
but at the same time, the court says, "there is other remedy." what i'm saying is, "either both remedies are available to me or none are available to me." they couldn't have said that, "you take this and not the other." that's right.
and... that's the purpose of article 341 cuts across the constitutional...
that's right. and that will become evident when your lordship looks at article 46.
because for the purposes of this constitution, of course, reservation under 15(4) and 16(4) is one aspect.
now, just have a look at 46(4).
i know your lordships are aware of it, but just for a moment, have a look at it.
"promotion of educational and economic interest of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other weaker sections. the state shall promote with special care, the educational and economic interest of the weaker sections of the people, and in particular of the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation." this is actually a postulate that, 'the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are deemed by the constitution to be weaker section." i'm grateful.
absolutely. and my lord, this 46 is couched in such broad language, that any affirmative action will be covered under this for the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes.
scholarship, the kind of examples the court gives in chinnaiah will be squarely covered by 46.
and if my lord now has 15(4) for a moment, because those measures are, in effect, protected by 15(4).
a government can give scholarship to only a sub category or a group only upon protection from 15(4).
so 46 and 15(4) are really two sides of the same coin.
so my lords that is my submission.
and therefore, the logic of chinnaiah if applied fully in fact is in my favour.
my lords i'm grateful to justice nath.
my lords my second submission is that there is a new provision introduced in 2018 and that is 342a.
your lordships may just have that provision first.
it is similar but not identical to 342, that's why your lordships were then required to interpret it in one judgment.
342a part-1. the president may with respect to any state or union territory and where it is a state after consultation with the governor thereof, by public notification specify the socially and educational backward classes in the central list, this is actually amended.
specify the bracketed portion your lordships will leave and be deemed to be socially and educationally backward in relation to the state or union territory as the case may be.
initially there was no reference to central list.
initially it read the socially and educational background classes which shall, for the purposes of this constitution, that's right.
so there was no reference to central list in the initial 2018 amendment, but clause 2, parliament made by law include in or exclude from central list of socially and educationally backward classes, specified in a notification issued under clause 1, any socially and educationally backward class.
but save as aforesaid, a notification issued under the said clause, shall not be varied by any subsequent notification.
so, clause 342a as it originally stood, part-1 of it was almost identical to part-1 or clause 1 of 342.
right. but insofar as clause 2 was there, there was the word central list, which is different even as it originally stood from 342.
therefore, the question which arose in jaishri patil's case is what is the real intent of the original amendment to 2018 amendment because the word central list is there.
so is it taking away the power of the states to actually identify the obcs.
because this is a provision which for the first time is introduced in 2018.
so the power to identify was all, unlike the sc/sts, the power even to identify was always with the states for obc.
now, this provision is introduced, 342a, and the question was, is that power lost?
the power of the state. power of the state, to identify.
and the court says, yes, it is lost in jaishri patil by reading the question was whether two will control one.
clause 2, central list will control 1 or 1 will control clause 2, really speaking.
and the court came to the conclusion that the word central list in 2 will be controlled by 1 and therefore the states have lost the power.
so, although the word central list is there in 342 in jaishri patil, your lordship says in effect, 342a is identical to 342.
that is from here on, for all purposes, not just central list.
it will be only the president and thereafter the parliament, which will identify the caste.
that is the majority in jaishri patil.
there are two judges dissenting on this also.
but that's the majority. three is to two my lords.
they also then held that till such time as the central government identifies, the state list will continue.
the central government is not so far identified, so the state list continues.
it is a matter of fact my lord.
that also needs to be looked at again, because the entire federal structure is disturbed because the states don't have any power anymore.
that's the whole issue. but the 21 amendment was before jaishri patil, right?
no, after. as a response to jaishri patil.
i'm just coming to that. i'm just coming to that.
this was 2018. jaishri patil was which year?
jaishri patil is 2020. 2021. my lords, the amendment is a response to jaishri patil's finding.
i will place that. now, my lords will just first have...
now the submission i'm making for the court's consideration is this.
that even in jaishri patil, where the court interpreted 342-a to be identical to 342, even though the word central lists were present in the second part.
despite that says that all, for all other purposes, that is, sub-classification, etc., etc. nothing changes.
so, here you have now for the sc, bcs, a structure like 342, but they are permitted to...
the states are permitted to sub-classify. that's my submission.
i'll just make that good by taking your lordships to the judgment.
so now on jaishri patil. your lordships has been straight away have page 1462 is where it begins and your lordships will have para 162, which is at pdf 1607.
at page number? this is that at page number 1607, pdf 1603 on the right hand side.
162. parliament, through the 102nd amendment, clearly intended that the existing legal regime for identification of communities as sc and st and for inclusion in the list of sc and sts under article 341 and 342 which had hitherto existed, ought to be replicated in relation to the identification of sc, bcs.
to achieve that, parliament inserted article 338-b, which is a mirror image of article 338 and 338-a.
the task assigned to the new commission for backward class, which is envisioned as a multi member commission are radically different from the duties which were assigned by parliament to the national commission for backward caste act under section 9 of the erstwhile sc/bc act, which was repealed just before the commencement of the 102nd amendment, the sc/bc was to examine requests for inclusion of any class of citizens of as backward classes in the list.
an advice of the commission was ordinarily binding upon the central government.
section 11 provided for a periodic revision of list.
as noticed by ashok bhushan j., article 338-b envisions a larger role for the new commission.
this commission not only advises the central government, but also the states.
it is impossible to read articles 338-b in isolation from the pre-existing para materia provisions.
it must be interpreted in the light of the two provisions which had existed all this while 338...
justice bhat also concurred with justice bhushan?
justice bhushan was in dissent. with justice nazir?
yes. so, on this point, my lords, the majority of this judgment was justice bhat, justice nageshwar rao, and justice nazir and the other two judges are really in a dissent.
on this point? on this. for this matter, this is the only point in this judgment which my submission is relevant.
relevant for this? yes. now those provisions clearly contemplate the same consultative role of the commission, et cetera.
i'm not going to read that. your lordships will now come to 166.
my learned friend wants me to read.
this commission not only advises the central government, but also the state.
it is impossible to read article 338-b in isolation from the preexisting para materia provisions.
it must be interpreted in the light of other two provisions which had existed all this while, article 338 and 338-a.
those provisions clearly contemplate the same consultative role with the commission on policy matters of the central government as well as the state government.
this is evident from clause 9 of these articles.
thus, the commission under article 338- b is not only assigned a constitutional role, but is also expected to act as an expert and engage with experts in the determination of the communities.
338-b(5) uses the term sc/bc, no less than on six occasions.
the expression also occurs in article 338 b(9).
thus, for the purpose of the constitution, the commission newly established under 338 b that is sc/bc shall be the only body to whom both the central government and the state government have to turn in all matters of policy, necessarily the question of matters of policy would also include identification of caste or communities at backward classes.
now, my lords will have 166 and i'll just read the first part, my lord.
i don't want to trouble your lordships with too many paras.
and i'll just formulate the point. " given the weight of such precedents which to this court giving full effect to the newly added provision by adopting the literal meaning in the definition set out in the constitution, as well as in the amendments to the definition clause, and all of which was noticed, the changes brought about through amendments and gave them plain effect. it is difficult to accept that the power of amendment of the constitution in accordance with the special procedure set out in 368, was used to bring about cosmetic changes conferring constitutional status." so, there are two arguments.
one argument was that, 'this 342a, if i may use the word slightly funnily worded in terms of difference from 342, was only to confer a constitutional status on the status quo, which was legally already present.' and the other argument was that, 'no, this actually brings it in line with 342. states lose the power to identify.' the court says it is not cosmetic.
it is substantive. and the states lose the power to identify.
" now, despite that, what the courts hold is what i am canvassing to the court, my lord. your lordship will have, para 168. and below, placitum e. "yet one must be mindful of a crucial fact, which is that the task for making special provisions under article 15 and for making reservations under article 64, extends to the states.
the power exercised by the president in relation to every state visa vis sc/st has been smooth and by all accounts, there has been no resentment or friction.
once the community or the caste concerned is reflected in the list of one or the other state union territory, the extent of benefits to be provided to members of such community is a matter that lies entirely in the state's domain.
" so, identification, the president does exclusively, and the parliament. but the nature of benefits will be rolled out is in that state's exclusive domain. now my lord will have para 182. it is at page 1616, pdf. "this court is also of the opinion, that the change brought about by the 102nd amendment, specially article 342-a, is only with respect to the process of identification of sc/bcs and their list.
" that is the real meaning of 342 as well. "necessarily the power to frame policies and legislations with regard to all other matters, that is, welfare schemes for sc/bc, setting up of institutions, grants, scholarship, extent of reservation and special provisions under 15 (4), 15 (5) and 16 (4), are entirely with the state government, in relation to its institutions and its public services, including services under the agencies and corporations and companies controlled by the state government.
in other words, the extent of reservation, the kind of benefits, the quantum of scholarship, the number of schools which are to be specially provided under 15 (4) or any other beneficial or welfare scheme, which is conceivable under 15(4) can all be achieved by the state through its legislative and executive powers.
these powers would include making suggestions and collecting data, if necessary, through statutory commissions for making recommendations towards inclusion and exclusion of caste and communities.
" so, my lords, that's the second part on... even on inclusion or exclusion, i can recommend. but once included or excluded, with that category, what is to be done? the entire gamut of things which can be done, is still with the state exclusively. so, my lords, this is... chinnaiah goes this way, this judgment in my respectful submission goes the opposite way. it identifies that there are two different things. which is the submission we are trying to make to the court. now, my lord finally, your lordships will have para 194.5.5. that is at page 1619. pdf 2623. and pdf page 1623. my lords 194.5.5. the state's power to make reservations in favour of particular communities or caste, the quantum of reservation, the nature of benefit and the kind of reservations and all other matters falling within the ambit of 15 ex-16, except with respect to identification of sc/bcs remains undisturbed. remains undisturbed except identification. my lords what is the sequitur of this? in sc/bcs, my lords there's sub-classification already. your lordships have seen indra sawhney. yes. now, here you have a provision which has been read by this court to be identical to 341 and except identification, everything else is left undisturbed. therefore, my lords that sub-classification power also has been left undisturbed. now my lords 3. what does the amendment do? i'll just conclude this point with that amendment. the amendment came as a response to this judgment my lords and that is clause 3. your lordships will have clause 3. notwithstanding anything contained in clauses 1 and 2, every state or union territory may by law prepare and maintain for its own purpose a list of socially and educationally backward classes, increase in which may be different from central list. my lords this restores the power to identify to the state, clause 3. i'll read it again. notwithstanding anything contained in clause 1 and 2, every state or ut may by law prepare and maintain for its own purpose a list of sc/bcs. so this restores the power to identify, which clause 1 and 2, as interpreted by jaishri patil did not provide. this is brought on 15th of september '21? correct. but my lords my submission is this. is the same amendment also amended clause 1? by bringing the central list. that's right. i'm grateful. that was brought in as well. specify the socially and educationally background classes in the central list, which, for the purpose of the central government. those words came in. so that's true. so it restores that position. but, so what it does is it restores the position vis-a-vis obcs pre the amendment and pre jaishri patil. that's what it does. but my submission is when the court took it as equal to 342, that is what jaishri patel is prior to the amendment. even at that stage, the court says everything else.... else is left to the state. and my lord that is in contra-distinction and complete contrast to the approach chinnaiah has stated. my lord that's the second submission. my lords my third and final submission... of course, both are judgments of five judges and since your lordships are in seven, we will commend my lords the approach of this judgment to your lordships as opposed to chinnaiah. my lords the third submission is that insofar as article 335 is concerned, my lords normally it is seen, although my lords some judgments of your lordships in recent times have undone that that it is a restriction on the principle of reservation. my lords i'll just read 335. "claims of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to services and posts'.
the claims of the members of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration in making appointments in the union or state.
consistent with maintenance of efficiency in administration.
my lords in my respectful submission, this provision actually is not a provision which is a limiting principle of reservation, certainly not in government service.
and my lords i'll try to make it good.
it is, in fact the enhancing principle for reservation and subcategorization, both.
i think i've dealt with this. in pavitra my lords, i'll place those paras.
i'll place. your lordships have dealt with them my lords directly in pavitra.
my lords but before i go to pavitra, just one submission.
my lords what is, this is about my lords efficiency is contextual.
yes. something which may be efficient in one context will cease to be efficient in other context.
now just one example. it depends on how you define efficiency.
if you define efficiency in an inclusive sense, by the inclusion of people who have hitherto been excluded from government, then it promotes efficiency.
also putting people from the marginalized communities in important positions of responsibility itself is receptive to the needs of those communities and to the needs for inclusion as a social doctrine.
and therefore, it's not really something which detracts from efficiency.
absolutely. and in addition... because the postulate of the constitution is not that people who belong to the marginalized groups are inefficient.
and those who belong to the other groups are efficient and therefore having more of the reserve categories will detract from efficiencies.
it's to the contrary. exactly. so that's there.
and in addition, this is... it is consistent with the need to maintain efficiency in administration.
yes, and efficiency in government administration is...
what is government administration? what is government?
government? what is government's business? government's business is the people.
so, when we are talking about efficiency in government administration, diversity by itself promotes efficiency.
that's my submission for the courts consideration.
efficiency in government administration will necessarily necessitate existence of diversity.
just example, when i came across... example.
in norway they recently took a child of an indian couple because the children were being fed through hand by the parents.
that is basically they don't have the understanding, diverse enough administration to understand this is a cultural but hygienic practice.
they assume that that's because you are using hands, they put the child in foster care.
so my lords efficiency in administration will require a certain amount of diversity, because otherwise you will have disastrous consequences of this kind of example.
there can be many other examples given, even in our context.
so, diversity is essential component of efficiency, especially in government administration, because you are dealing with a diverse public.
you're not dealing with just a section.
you're not government of a or b, you are government of everybody.
and i'll just place the paras in pavitra.
where is pavitra? volume 5-a. it begins, your lordships will have page 111 pdf, page 111 pdf, para 124.
the substantive para 124, page 111 pdf.
yes. the substantive part of 335 contains a mandate, a requirement to take into consideration the claim of scs and sts in making appointments to services and post in connection with the affairs of the union or of a state.
consideration is much broader in its ambit than reservation.
the consideration of their claims to appointment is to be in a manner consistent with maintaining the efficiency of administration.
the proviso specifically protects provisions in favour of sc/st for relaxing, qualifying in any examination, lowering the standard or reservation in a matter of promotion.
reservation is encompassed within the special provision.
but the universe of the latter is wider.
now my lords, just have 126. lordships have written a lot of paras.
i'll just focus on the ones which assist us the most.
para 126. the constitution does not define what the framers meant by the phrase efficiency of administration.
article 335 cannot be construed on the basis of a stereotypical assumption.
that roster point promotes drawn from the sc/sts are not efficient or that efficiency is reduced by appointing them.
this is stereotypical because it masks deep rooted social prejudice.
the benchmark for the efficiency of administration is not some disembodied abstract ideal measured by the performance of a qualified open category candidate.
efficiency of administration in the affairs of the union or of a state must be defined in an inclusive sense where diverse segments of a society find representation as a true aspiration of governance by and for the people.
if, as we hold the constitution mandates realization of substantive equality in the engagement of the fundamental rights with the directive principles, inclusions together with the recognition of plurality and diversity of the nation, constitutes a valid constitutional basis for defining efficiency.
our benchmarks will define outcomes. if this benchmark of efficiency is grounded in exclusion, it will produce a pattern of governance which is skewed against the marginalized.
if this benchmark of efficiency is grounded in equal access, our outcomes will reflect the commitment of constitution to produce a just social order.
otherwise, a pass will haunt the inability of a society to move away from being deeply unequal to one which is founded on liberty and fraternity.
hence, while interpreting 335, it is necessary to liberate the concept of efficiency from a one-sided approach, which ignores the need for the positive effects of the inclusion of diverse segments of society on the efficiency of administration of the union or of a state, establishing the position of scs and sts worthy participants in affairs of governance is intrinsic to an equal citizenship.
equal citizenship recognizes governance, which is inclusive, but also ensures that these segments of our society which have suffered in history, prejudice, etc., are the real voice and governance.
since inclusion is inseparable from a well governed society, therein i would know antithesis between maintaining of efficiency and considering the claims of sc/ st.
" so, my lord, this formulation, i respectfully submit, should be adopted by your lordships in the 7-judge combination, so that, my lord, 335 is not seen as a limiting principle to reservation, but as a principle to expand. just like firstly 16(4) was seen as exception to 16 (1), in the initial jurisprudence of this court. and then your lordships have held that, 16(4) is actually a facet of 16 (1). similarly, this is also in fact a facet. and therefore my lord, insofar as chinnaiah, which, at two places.... indra sawhney also rejects the argument that reservation is anti meritorious. that's right. merit is what they call, my lords, in one of these books, 'nurtured talent.' now, if somebody doesn't get to, and something called natural talent. i think i've also considered that here on how benchmarks and.... yes, my lord. your lordships have done a very detailed, this thing. i'm not reading all of it, but the principle really is that, 335 is not, efficiency in governance is not about efficiency for a particular group or defined in a void. it's not rocket science, particularly in government, when you're dealing with people, efficiency has to mean, "how does the government really deal with all the people?
" and if i may submit, we really don't know, "what real efficiency is", because real equality really has not arrived in our government. my lords, we will see the true meaning of 335, when we have a substantive equality, and then we'll see what real efficiency is. that's the true meaning of 335. so, insofar as chinnaiah, my lord, in some paragraph says that, "this sub-classification will also be contrary to the principle of efficiency.
it's neither contrary to principle of efficiency for normal classification or for sub classification.
" that's my third submission. thank you. mr... i will just.... there is one... i will not quote it but, we used to read in our ncert book as 'gandhi ji's talisman,' that "whatever you do, you must think of the weakest person and it does that help to that weakest person and all your doubts will disappear.
" this is one of those instances where what the state is doing is actually helping the weakest person.
i'm grateful. thank you mr. farasat. mr. sibal, we start tomorrow morning?
we're almost on the envelope. what we will do is, now, we've substantially covered a lot of ground, we've covered a lot of substantial ground.
we'll conclude the submissions of this side by lunchtime tomorrow.
so that then we can ask the others to...
the other side to argue. so we'd like to wrap up tomorrow.
because we'll see what they have to say after this, we'll conclude the...
not an issue. so, just as you leave, maybe the others were to follow, between yourselves, ration the time for the people who are appearing on?
not an issue. we'll organise that. grateful.
