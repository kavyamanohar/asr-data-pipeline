it is a matter which is vested today itself.
with respect, if i may submit?
the question here is, it was de-tagged in two thousand nine.
again, somehow in twenty sixteen, it got tagged.
who are you appearing for ma'am?
i'm appearing for kesar enterprises and state of up is the appellant. my learned friend.
so does this have to be tagged or de-tagged?
my friend says is that this is a matter pertaining to potable alcohol and it
resulted in wastage because of accident.
therefore, the state was demanding excise duty on potable alcohol there.
so we are not concerned with potable alcohol at all.
so can we just de-tag that matter?
i think it can be.
because, this matter does not pertain to industrial alcohol at all.
it pertains to wastage of potable liquor, which is for human consumption, my lord. so
we can de-tag that.
it can be.
i am deeply obliged.
just keep this, you've taken the number.
but before i begin my lord, i must submit an apology.
because of my colourful grey hair.
because of the holi part.
that's the disadvantage of having too many children and grandchildren.
you can't save yourself.
nothing to do with the alcohol.
it does my lord. holi means partly alcohol, and i must confess i am fond
of at least whiskey part.
to begin with this daunting task, your lordship might permit me to place one or
two pages of my written submission initially because that will highlight the question involved and
what has to be considered and answered by lordships. this is pdf page.
volume one (a) my lord. volume one (a).
it is a daunting task to appear before nine judges with this court, but then
it is made more daunting by your lordship's insistence on the paperless series.
do you realize how simple it is?
it cuts down on time and it's so streamlined for all of you because you
can switch from file to file.
maybe at your lordship's age perhaps it's easier, but of my age, it becomes a
little more difficult.
what are you saying, dwivedi?
have lordships have my written submissions?
yes. volume one (a).
but the issue involved in this case is primarily concerning state's jurisdiction over industrial alcohol
or rectified spirit, for short ia, industrial alcohol, and this rectified spirit is also called
ethyl alcohol as an alternative.
in the synthetics second case, that is, the nineteen ninety supreme court, it was categorically
held that rectified, the denatured spirit is industrial alcohol and is outside the state's jurisdiction
under entry eight, list ii of the eighth schedule to the constitution. entry eight, list
ii, when it refers to intoxicating liquor deals only with potable alcohol, when it is
had as it is.
synthetics too, further went to the extent of denying jurisdiction to states in relation to
industrial alcohol, even under entry thirty three, list iii, as products of a notified brief
scheduled industry under the industrial development regulation act. hereinafter, it was idea namely declaration by
parliament under section two of the idr act read with section eighteen of the idr
act covers the entire field, ousting state's jurisdiction.
the sole issue broadly is whether states have legislative jurisdiction to deal with and regulate
industrial alcohol as well as the expanse of it; whether the jurisdiction is exclusive or
concurrent.
synthetics too is erroneous on both the terms.
it is for this reason that the reference order of the constitution bench dated august
twelfth twenty ten doubts the correctness of it after meticulously examining the judgment.
the state's jurisdiction over industrial alcohol can be exercised in two ways.
a) state has jurisdiction and control over industrial alcohol under entry eight, list ii or
states have jurisdiction in respect of industrial alcohol under entry thirty three, list iii as
a product of notified scheduled industry under the idr act, and the field is unoccupied.
this is a statement which your lordship must mark that the field is unoccupied.
because entry thirty three in list iii, question of occupied field will arise.
intoxicating. i'll come to this.
then kindly have.
i have framed for your lordships convenience the questions.
page twenty nine.
your lordships have page twenty nine of the volume one?
page twenty nine of the volume one itself would have the questions.
'whether state can regulate and control industrial alcohol'.
.
page twenty nine.
it's page twenty nine of volume one (a).
same volume.
questions for consideration.
'whether state can regulate and control industrial alcohol, commonly called rectified spirits of more than
ninety five percent v/v including denatured spirit.
this has two aspects.
(a) one, whether industrial alcohol is included in entry eight, list ii and is therefore,
within its exclusive jurisdiction and control.
or two, whether it falls under entry twenty four of list ii and therefore, can
travel on to entry fifty two of list i on specification of fermentation industry as
a notified industry under industrial disputes, development and regulation act'.
my lord, this question, if i may pause for a moment and elaborate a little?
entry fifty two, list i is the entry under which idr act was issued in
the year nineteen fifty one enabling the centre or the union to specify which of
the industries it wants to take over.
now, entry fifty two is intricately linked with entry twenty four, list ii. your lordship
would have entry twenty four.
would you like to just sort of show us the entry so that we can
at the outset.
i'll come to that.
let's look at the entries first.
the whole thing turns in on the construction of the entries in this case.
quite right.
so let's look at the different entries which are involved.
that's the best way to go about it.
then we'll, of course, read your questions.
the first entry to be taken into consideration is entry fifty two, list i. this
is where the synthetics ii had placed industrial alcohol, because idr act comes in and
fermentation industry was notified in the year nineteen fifty six under the schedule to the
idr act, implying thereby that the declaration under idr act would apply and this industry
is abstracted from entry twenty four, list ii and goes on to entry fifty two,
list i. so once a declaration is made, entry fifty two comes in operation.
otherwise entry fifty two, list i has no.
it's a shell.
it is inoperative until unless there is a declaration.
so you find a placed entry fifty two.
yes. may i?
'industries, the control of which by the union is declared by parliament by law to
be expedient in the public interest'.
so what it implies is those industries where the union feels that the control should
come to the union and the parliament has to declare it by law, that law
will indicate the extent of control it wants to take over also.
and that industry to that extent, comes over too.
but importantly, along with fifty two, if i may juxtapose entry twenty four, list ii
because we can't understand entry fifty two, list i without looking into entry twenty four,
list ii. twenty four is industries subject to the provision of entry seven in fifty
two of list i. so there is an inherent link between entry fifty two, list
i and entry twenty four, list ii. industry as a subject originally belongs to the
state jurisdiction.
just for a moment, keep out the idr act or the declaration.
entry twenty four is subordinate to entry fifty two of list one.
no difficulty.
it is.
there's no doubt about it.
it is subject to.
but what i am saying is that let us for a moment, for the purposes
of analysis, take out the idr act or the declaration.
then what conclusion that comes to the fore is that entry twenty four is the
basic entry where state has jurisdiction over industry.
now, that word, 'industry' transports to or gets transported to entry fifty two on a
declaration by parliament. if parliament makes a declaration.
no, that.
actually entry fifty two.
entry twenty four of list i. of list ii is made subject to entry fifty
two of list one.
entry fifty two of list one, which gives the dominance to a parliamentary law is,
provided parliament has made a declaration in the law of entry fifty two.
that's what i'm saying.
unless there is a declaration, the jurisdiction vests in the state. obviously. thats it.
right. but once the declaration is made under entry fifty two.
then that part which is taken over goes to the union. further, very interesting thing
is, look at entry fifty four in contrast to fifty two.
i mean, you were dealing with entry fifty four just two weeks ago.
yes, mines and minerals. 'mines and mineral development to the extent to which regulation and
development under the control of the union is declared by parliament by law to be
expedient in the public interest'.
now, the words, 'to the extent to which' are interestingly absent in entry fifty two.
there is a reason.
so, once parliament makes a declaration, as in this case under section two, the entirety
of that field of that industry is within the control.
it's not to be extent to it.
i'll answer that question.
that question has very frequently arisen, and lordships have answered it on a number of
occasions.
the word, ' fifty four ' here, if your lordship could once again have a
look at fifty four.
there's a difference in the two entries.
yes. 'regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and
development under the control of the union is declared by parliament by law to be
expedient in public interest'.
now, the word, 'to the extent to which' has been used for an obvious reason.
word not here, the entry fifty four includes both the manufacturing that is mines.
that's the factory part, the manufacturing part and includes mineral.
so there's nothing else there left.
so both the things come over here on a declaration.
unlike industries, when a declaration is made, the product of the industry doesn't go there.
here, the product of the industry is taken over under entry twenty four.
but in case of industry, entry fifty two.
your lordship may have entry thirty three, list iii. so it's not that the whole
industry goes over or everything goes relating to that industry goes over.
kindly have entry thirty three, list iii. so we will have to consider, what is
the ambit of the word, 'industry', and that will have to be assessed first and
foremost in the context of the state entries.
the reason being, entry twenty four is intricately linked with entry fifty two, because whatever
can be drawn under entry fifty two is from entry twenty four and no other
entry.
then kindly have twenty six and twenty seven.
entry twenty six and twenty seven of list ii. actually just dwell on entry thirty
three.
very well. you can read entry thirty three.
that might help you.
'trade and commerce in and the production, supply and distribution of the products of any
industry where the control such industry by the union is declared by parliament by law
to be expedient in public interest and imported goods of the same kind as such
product'.
so therefore, trade and commerce, supply and distribution don't go to entry fifty two.
so it's very interesting because once a declaration is made by law of parliament under
entry fifty two, the trade and commerce is taken out of the field of entry
fifty two and immediately goes into entry thirty three of list iii. as product of
the notified industry.
right. to the extent therefore, the regulation of trade and commerce, production, supply and distribution
best goes into the concurrent list. the law made then by the state legislature can
be overridden by a law which is made by article two fifty four.
there is no difficulty.
and i'll say as i said.
but entry thirty three.
entry thirty three is an indication that notwithstanding a declaration which is made under entry
fifty two, a law made by parliament under entry fifty two of list i, they
still lie in the province of the states, albeit under the concurrent list, namely trade,
commerce and production, supply and distribution.
now importantly, since lordships have noticed this, kindly come to the state list again.
in other words, the domain of entry fifty two will be everything pertaining to that
industry minus entry thirty three.
yes. it will be more apparent.
we note an exception.
absolutely. entry thirty three, list iii, it carves out an exception within the domain of
entry fifty two, list i. yes, your lordship is right because then now trade and
commerce, supply and distribution would not come under entry fifty two, list i, even if
it is a notified industry.
but before i proceed further, kindly have again, once again, come to the state list.
list ii, entry twenty four and if your lordship would permit me to elaborate on
this, then things would become clearer.
which entry? twenty four.
once again, industries subject to the provisions of entry seven and fifty two.
now, we are not concerned with seven.
we're concerned with fifty two of list i. in other words, your lordships are right
when lordships said that it is subject to, therefore, subordinative.
now, the important part is, kindly see entry twenty six.
state list. entry? twenty six.
'trade and commerce within the state subject to the provisions of entry thirty three of
list iii'.
so the trade and commerce in the product of the industry is still in the
state list. i'm saying for a moment imagine that there's no idr for entry fifty
two.
then what is the position?
then entry twenty six of list ii would be subordinate to entry thirty three.
list iii. that's accepted, my lord. i would accept that.
there's no doubt about it.
then twenty seven again.
entry twenty seven.
entry thirty three is the combination of these two entries, twenty six and twenty seven.
sorry. let me again explain it from the ground level, which is the state list.
now state list contains three entries, your lordships have seen.
industry, which is basically state subject.
then the trade and commerce and the production and supply do not fall in the
word, 'industry' because there is a separate entry for that, twenty six and twenty seven.
so twenty six and twenty seven will never come toward industry.
now, when the idr act makes a declaration with regard to any industry, there are
a couple of questions that will arise.
one is, what will idr act take from the state list, the declaration?
it will only draw from entry twenty four.
it can't take over from entry twenty six and twenty seven because that goes to
entry thirty three.
the product of the declared or unnotified or scheduled industry doesn't fall in entry fifty
two but goes to entry thirty three.
right. now the question is, my lord. so therefore, the entire doctrine of occupied field
may not then be applicable to entry fifty two of list i, because on the
face of the entry, a certain field notwithstanding the declaration under entry fifty two of
list i, falls under entry thirty three of list iii. undoubtedly. and the object of
the parliament, of the framers in putting it in entry fifty three was, notwithstanding the
declaration under entry fifty two, the states will still have power in respect of trade,
commerce, production, supply and distribution.
right. now, before we come to.
these entries twenty six and twenty seven, advisedly they are not made subject to entry
fifty two.
my lord, not made subject to.
subject to thirty three.
they are only subject to thirty three and twenty four is subject to fifty two,
not twenty six and twenty seven.
they are independent entries.
so if the parliament wants to take over anything pertaining to the trade and commerce,
supply and distribution, then it has to pass some law under thirty three.
now, the other correction which i may be permitted to make is.
what is your.
now we've seen the entries.
no, there are two broad arguments, my lord. one is.
what is theoretical structure that you are saying?
first we say, first we say, my lord. anything else you want us to?
let's complete the entries.
yes, then have.
kindly have entry six.
of?
list ii. public health and sanitation, hospitals and dispensaries.
omit the rest, take public health into consideration.
and then eight.
word is, 'intoxicating liquors'.
now, that is to say, is an illustrative.
illustration of what follows.
that intoxicating liquor.
in relation to that production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase, sale of intoxicating liquors.
the question is, what is the term, 'intoxicating liquor' stand for?
and this term has abundant legislative history, which we call the legal sense.
so, the question is, when your lordships are considering this term, my request would be
your lordships will have to place your lordships in the positions of the framers and
see how they saw this term at that point of time, what the law was,
what was the legal history, the legal sense.
it is not always that in terms of the legislative power, your lordships have relied
upon the popular and the common-sense point of view.
because more often than not, the entries have entirely different.
any other entries that we have missed or that's now the sum total?
yes. now, my lord, the next entry in the state list, which i would pray
lordship may have apart from what lordships have seen, entry fifty one, list. it says,
'duties of excise on the following goods, manufactured or produced in the state and countervailing
duties at the same or lower rates on similar goods, manufactured or produced elsewhere in
india'.
so, duties of excise on the following goods: a) alcoholic liquors for human consumption.
is it same as intoxicating liquor?
that's the question which your lordships would have to deal with, right.
because why would framers use different words in two different entries?
and the reason my answer is the legislative history is there.
that is why.
is there any liquor which is not intoxicating?
i don't think so.
at least, i have not experienced.
depends on the consumer, i suppose.
it depends on the person who drinks it.
that would be the strength of the effect.
but effect will be there.
all liquids containing alcohol, they are intoxicating.
i can't imagine of a liquor which is not intoxicating, be it industrial alcohol. of
course, intoxicating means alcoholic content.
industrial alcohol has higher alcoholic content, that's all.
it can't be had as it is.
but then, do we have whiskey as it is?
we have it with soda or water, normally.
that again depends.
neat, we must say.
for that matter, some people do have neat liquor.
but then, that's what i'm trying to explain, the neat liquor is also, more often
than not, mixed with ice cubes.
it's not a constitutional issue.
no, but it has been, my lord kindly have article forty seven.
kindly have article forty seven.
it says, 'state can prohibit consumption of alcoholic drinks'.
so, whenever they refer to beverage form or something that can be had as it
is, neat, as lord justice has said.
there article forty seven refers to that as intoxicating drink.
so, whole lot of different phrases have been used in different entries.
there has to be some purpose behind it.
and that is what my endeavour would be to show why.
but in any case, at least one assumption i can make is when we read
entry fifty one, list ii, when it says alcoholic liquor for human consumption.
there is one reason, possibly, why they said.
otherwise, liquors would have been sufficient.
why do they use intoxicating liquor?
that is a question which legal history.
legal, the state of law, which preceded our constitution as necessary, that indicates.
as mister datar will tell you, if you go down south or mister giri will
tell you that even when somebody serves you coffee, they'll ask you, do you want
to have the liquor?
when you have the coffee liquor, it's not the decoction.
the decoction is very often referred to as a liquor, but it's not intoxicating liquor.
coffee liquor.
coffee powder is mixed with chicory.
different decoction.
it has been carried on for some generation.
so it's liquor, but it's not the intoxicating liquor.
we have a history in our country of alcohol.
it's not alcohol, but it's still referred to as liquor.
not when we are talking of whiskey and liquor, the coffee liquor seems to be
little.
i know.
coffee liquor is very different.
that is liquor.
yeah. spirits. it is spirits.
my real problem in this matter is, what is the learned attorney general going to
argue when you people are done?
the bigger problem would be what most of your lordship would do without understanding what
liquor is?
that would be a bigger problem.
the attorney's whole argument is going to be purely theoretical.
attorney, you have an uphill task.
let him have liquor, my lord. he will conquer the hill.
some of us can do it more impartially.
we know nothing about liquor, nothing more.
kerala high court. impact on hatcheries.
because three hundred and one, three hundred and four etcetera.
chief justice dattu asked me, mister venkataramani, how much did you know about chickens?
so i said, i don't know, but the internal motion, but i know there's motions
from state to state.
so, that's talking about coffee.
the kumbakonam degree coffee, which is the highest coffee.
yes. there's a very important question.
liquor other than intoxication and intoxicating liquor.
that's the secret of entry eight.
attorney doesn't sound very convincing with regard to coffee liquor.
he must graduate onto the liquor part.
yes, mister dwivedi. now coming back to the.
kindly have.
your lordship has seen it's a taxing entry, entry fifty one, list ii. and duties
of excise, which means tax on production and manufacture.
now the parallel entry is there in the union list, entry eighty four.
now my lordship would have to see it before the amendment because now twenty sixteen.
gst, et cetera has really spoiled the shape of the entries.
page twenty sixteen.
it would be there in the footnote.
yes, we got it in the footnote.
you have to thank mister sankaranarayanan for producing this masterpiece.
no, that's page four hundred and seventy one.
now kindly juxtapose this entry fifty one with entry eighty four.
the parallel of this entry in the union list because for tax purpose it seems
framers divided this thing.
alcoholic liquor for human consumption and alcoholic liquor not for human consumption.
so liquor was divided into two categories.
now coming back to entry fifty one again.
now with due respect i'm sorry, there's something which i should have pointed out earlier.
it contains two items.
three items, in fact.
your lordship would see alcoholic liquors for human consumption, that's one item.
the other item is opium, indian hemp etcetera.
and the third item is medicinal and toilet preparations which are in the exclusion clause,
but not including medicinal toilet preparations containing alcohol.
so all these cough syrups which have alcohol, will go to the centre?
for tax.
for tax.
for tax.
but the interesting part, which i wanted to really emphasize here is, there is no
regulatory entry in any of the lists either specifying the word, 'industrial alcohol' or stating
alcoholic liquors not for human consumption.
there is no legislative entry in any of the list, list i or iii. so
does it mean that industrial alcohol is not meant for human consumption?
obviously my lord, it can't be had, because the strength of the liquor is ninety
five percent, ninety seven percent, ninety percent to ninety five percent.
yes. which is dangerous for health.
mister dwivedi, you just said no regulatory entry in any list using the phrase, industrial
alcohol or?
the 'or' i missed out.
or alcoholic liquor not for human consumption.
i can understand, if the idea was to regulate these two.
tax these two.
then there should be some regulatory provision somewhere.
intoxicating liquor is one such entry, your lordships may keep it in mind.
but apart from that, there is no entry to regulate industrial alcohol or alcoholic liquors
not for human consumption.
and more importantly, if your lordships would see medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol, there
is no legislative entry in any of the lists.
and the question therefore, which comes to my mind, which i placed before your lordship
and i'll try to answer that.
why?
taxing entry only regulates part of it, the help intoxicating liquor or alcoholic liquor but
the rest of the parts are where, we don't know.
we have to speculate.
synthetics puts it in entry fifty two because of idr. now, if we put it
in entry fifty two, then obvious thing would be, that it goes to entry twenty
four then.
because you can't pick up from any other entry excepting twenty four, so far as
the industry is concerned.
so if we place it in entry fifty two, then pugnacity, it must go to
entry twenty four.
but medicinal preparations containing alcohol will go to list i?
no. but which entry?
entry ninety seven.
no, i'll answer that.
i'll answer that.
if entry ninety seven has been determined to be so huge, and what was the
point in having these entries?
they could have just said list ii and iii, entry ninety seven.
it would have included everything.
but the medicinal preparation containing alcohol, then the duty of.
power to levy duty of excise, where will that go, according to you?
no, duty of excise is there, entry eighty four.
right. entry eighty four, list i, it clearly includes.
unamended.
it includes.
so that's what i am saying, my lord, the idea is to have these items
as separate items, but for tax only, but not for regulation.
so entry eighty four will cover medicinal preparation which have alcohol?
for taxation.
act, of course.
yes. so what appears, apparently is that until, unless we look into the legislative history
of this word, 'intoxicating liquor', and the laws pertaining to alcoholic liquors.
now, we have seen the entire gamut of entries, right?
my lord. now, why don't you formulate what your points are?
yes. once we do that, we'll go to synthetics and see.
it's not a very long matter.
it will have to trace the legislative.
obviously, but why don't you formulate it?
no, we'll look at the legislative history of intoxicating liquors, but now you can just
formulate what your submissions are.
yes. the first question again is, as i pointed out.
you've made a note at page twenty nine.
fifty nine, yes.
pdf page thirty.
but now why don't you formulate what your points are?
my lord, the first question, which i'm going to canvas for your lordship is, that
entry eight, list ii, which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the states to regulate industrial alcohol.
which confers exclusive.
jurisdiction on the states to regulate industrial alcohol, because industrial alcohol is part of intoxicating
liquor.
so, the scope of entry eight.
industrial alcohol is part of intoxicating liquor?
liquor. and therefore, states have exclusive jurisdiction.
so, your first submission is, entry eight of list ii confers exclusive jurisdiction on states
to regulate industrial alcohol because industrial alcohol is part of intoxicating liquor.
liquor. intoxicating liquor, your lordship may note it down.
intoxicating liquor is a general term.
yes. unlimited. it has not been restricted by any phrases, before or after.
is a general term.
unrestricted, by any other entry.
unlike twenty four.
to put it in a better form, it's a specific entry.
industry is a general entry.
this is a specific entry, which at least three constitution benches of lordships have held
that to.
this intoxicating liquor is a general term unrestricted by any other entry.
entry and perhaps, lord, it's a special entry in state list as compared to entry
twenty four which is a general entry.
industry can include any industry.
but if, your lordship would see entry eight.
it says production, manufacture, sale, purchase, everything is there.
it includes virtual every activity relating to intoxicating.
and in mcdowell's case, lordships have held this very clearly, that it's a special entry
as compared to industry, which is a general entry.
for instance, your lordships may have a look at.
i'm sorry.
entry twenty five, list ii. if i may place now, entry twenty five, list ii
says gas and gas works.
that's an industry.
but the question which i'm posing is, does it fall under word, 'industry' then?
if there is a specific entry which has been carved out of the word, 'industry'.
entry twenty four cannot be deemed to include gas and gas works.
because if 'industry' was wide enough to include gas and gas works, then what was
the point in having it there?
it can't by interpretation, make the entry redundant.
likewise, entry eight is a special entry as compared to the general entry, industry.
entry twenty four.
could the power to legislate on industrial alcohol. because that is to say, kindly, have
the elaborateness of the illustrative part, that is to say, is an illustrative word, but
get the elaborateness of the illustrative part.
it says, 'production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating liquor'.
what else is left then apart from this, i ask myself?
it's a complete entry.
which completes.
which includes every aspect of industry.
intoxicating liquor.
though i have to answer that question whether intoxicating liquor is wide or not.
no, the question is whether intoxicating liquor would include industrial alcohol?
that is the question.
that's the question.
and for that, one of the aspects which i had indicated and emphasized.
wouldn't we postulate something which is for human consumption by its very nature.
that's one way of looking at it.
as i said, this is an entry which is general and uncontrolled.
now, intoxicating can mean intoxicate, causing intoxication to the humans.
it can also mean a liquor which contains intoxicating element which can cause intoxication.
so to confine this entry to only that aspect that it may cause intoxication to
humans when it is had as it is, as a drink.
intoxicating drink.
can we have article forty seven for a moment?
the purpose of industrial alcohol is never to intoxicate.
that's why alcohol is a completely different.
i'll answer that question, it is.
the ordinary use of the article must be seen.
my lord, the term industrial alcohol. let us not confuse the two things.
it may not be fit for human consumptions as it is.
there's no difficulty.
but to say that it is not intoxicating, that is not correct.
because it has alcohol.
it has high quantity of alcohol.
therefore, it is intoxicating.
we are attributing this term, 'intoxication' to humans only, that may not be correct, considering
the wide entry that it is.
and a general entry, which is unrestricted.
because if it was only human consumption then entry fifty one explained it.
so why use the different phraseology?
the phraseology would have been there in entry eight.
alcoholic liquor for human consumption, that is to say.
framers would not use two entirely different phrases for denoting the same thing.
that's one aspect which i have.
and i will show.
because if you see entry eighty four, clause a, as it then fit, duties of
excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in india, except (a) alcoholic liquors
for human consumption.
there only the state can levy.
levy duty.
yes. so again, the phrase is alcoholic liquor for human consumption.
now, my question to myself is that, if alcoholic liquor for human consumption was a
set phrase used by the framers to denote alcoholic drinks or beverage form or which
can be had by the humans, then the same phraseology should have been there in
entry eight, if the idea was to indicate the same thing.
and there is a reason why it is not so.
because as i said, legislative history is very critical in this regard.
what you are looking at it is, if it is a declared industry, then obviously
the state will not have any jurisdictions with regard to it.
then only the centre can have the jurisdiction over that entry.
there's no difficulty.
but the question which i had posed before your lordship was, if intoxicating liquor falls
under entry eight, then it is not an industry under entry twenty four.
and if it is not an industry under twenty four, then it cannot be taken
over under idr, because then the parliament would be determining the scope of the legislative
entry.
we have entry twenty four which says in list ii, industries subject to the provisions
of entry seven and fifty two of list i. so therefore, word 'industry' cannot include
word 'intoxicating liquor', 'manufacturer of intoxicating liquor', because both are separate entries specified in the
state list only.
one is special, the other is general.
the special has been carved out, as i cited the example of gas and gas
works.
your lordships would recall calcutta gas case but your lordships specifically said it's a special
entry, gas works.
intoxicating liquor.
mister dwivedi, i've formulated your third point like this.
entry fifty one and entry fifty four of list ii use the expression, 'alcoholic liquor
for human consumption'.
entry eight of list ii would have used the same phrase, if the framers so
intended.
but entry eight, list ii uses a wider phrase, namely, 'intoxicating liquors'.
if intoxicating liquor falls under entry eight of list ii, it does not fall under
entry twenty four of list ii and is therefore not subject to entry fifty two
of list ii. union cannot drag it to list i. that's your.
so, really speaking, i think what we now have to focus on is, what do
the constitution mean when they use the expression 'intoxicating liquors'.
and let's look at the legislative background of the use of the expression.
because mister dwivedi then, everything really either your argument, either falls or survives on the
content of entry eight.
does entry eight intoxicating liquor include as industrial alcohol?
absolutely. that's the right.
but the alternative argument is, that even if industry is, the second question, which i
am formulating is, that even if word, 'industry' includes industrial alcohol. even if industry.?
word 'industry' includes industrial alcohol. in entry fifty two?
first it has to include in entry twenty four.
right. so alternatively, even if industry in entry twenty four.
then only it can be taken over under entry fifty two.
no, we are just formulating it.
i want to understand your point of view, alternative view.
right. but if we.
one second.
let's just hold the thought down.
i am sorry.
alternatively, even if industry in entry twenty four or entry fifty one.
fifty two, list one.
fifty two of list i includes.
industrial alcohol. industrial alcohol. then?
then whatever goes to list i is the manufacture.
what?
manufacture of industrial alcohol. and once the industrial alcohol as product to be notified in
industry emerges, it goes to entry thirty three.
the product is not included in entry twenty four or fifty two.
so, what is included in industry and not the product, that's what you are saying?
not the product.
my lord, it has been well defined, there are at least seven constitution benches, which
say word, 'industry' only denotes manufacture.
it does not include trade, commerce or production, supply and distribution.
word, 'production' has been brought out of caution.
it has been used, but manufacture goes to industry.
actually, so even if we reject your point on intoxicating liquor covering industrial alcohol, the
alternative limb, which frankly appears to be more acceptable, the alternative limb, the alternative.
but you may be right, because we have not looked still at the legislative history.
your lordship would look at it in the sense of a timeline my lord, perhaps,
not the alternative may appear to be the easier one to go to and decide.
something which is pending for fourteen years, there's no timeline.
we have to look at both aspects.
but that's why your second limb is that even assuming it's industry within entry twenty
four, and therefore, under entry fifty two, only the manufacture falls within entry fifty two
of list i. product goes.
the rest of the product is governed by entry thirty three, and if it falls
in entry thirty three, then you can levy fees under.
but the jurisdiction doesn't arise, my lord. right. jurisdiction of state doesn't arise.
jurisdiction is there.
because you can levy fees then, fees in respect of any of the entries.
if we come to the conclusion about the jurisdiction part, then what can be the
ambit of jurisdiction is a separate issue.
which that can be adverted to, and the disputes will arise, they can keep on
coming off and on and can be answered.
but the issue is of state's jurisdiction, whether it is there or not, to regulate
and control industrial alcohol. now, another interesting aspect here would be.
we have.
if i may answer here?
i could be over hear.
so, these are the four submissions or there are alternative submissions?
the b part of that last argument is, that state will only have jurisdiction if
the field is unoccupied.
under entry thirty three.
under entry thirty three.
so, article two hundred and fifty four comes in.
and we have expressly stated that till date there is no legislation by the union.
because under the idr act, section eighteen-g, is there.
if i may place that, lordship, may have a look at it.
this would be the last limb, section eighteen-g of the idr act. so, what is
the submission?
section eighteen-g, how do you formulate it?
then we look at it.
section eighteen-g confers an enabling power on the union to regulate the products of the
notified industries.
for securing equitable distribution and availability at fair price, they can regulate.
and that regulation has to be through an order issued by the central government, a
notified order.
it's like a control order.
so, union has to regulate by a notified order providing for regulation.
section eighteen-g, we have got it on the screen here.
it will be on the screen.
yes. section eighteen-g is in volume iv, page is yours a pdf, page five hundred
and seventy seven.
now, this section eighteen-g is traceable to entry thirty three, list iii. 'the central government,
so far as it appears to it to be necessary or experienced for securing the
equitable distribution and availability at fair price or any article or class of articles relatable
to any scheduled industry may, notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this act
by notified order'.
so, may be notified order, provide for regulating the supply and distribution thereof and trade
and commerce therein.
so, it has to be a notified order?
it has to be a notified.
because if i recall correctly, i have listed and i'll get it, get hold of
it.
chief justice has in one of the judgment-two hundred fifty four has said there has
to be, in fact, an order there.
it has to be real conflict, has to be actual conflict.
not supposed conflict that's in future order may be issued and then conflict may arise.
so, there has to be a real conflict, actual conflict before jurisdiction can be taken
away.
that's in the case of context of occupied field.
the field is occupied only when there is an order under eighteen-g. as my friend
rightly says that under two hundred and fifty four, state can still legislate and get
the presidential assent to override them.
yes. but that's a different issue.
i would not.
but then that is, at least that indicates that the field has to be actually
occupied.
and there is no notified order by them?
there. at least, i could not discover any notified order.
my friend has also asserted that and in response my lord, in their written submission
they don't say that there is a notified order.
they say that it's not required.
right. now, if my lordships would come to my written submissions.
may i take your lordships to my written submissions?
now my lords, there's one provision which i perhaps should have also cited but i
forgot to do that.
your lordships may have article forty seven, which also has some bearing on our question.
though this is non-enforceable, it does not impose any restriction on the legislative power but
it certainly gives an indication.
'the state shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and standard of living
of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties.
and in particular, the state shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of consumption except for
medicinal purpose of intoxicating drinks'.
so where they wanted to restrict to beverage form, which is had as it is,
they used a term, 'intoxicating drinks'.
consumption. this shows in the beverage form it is there as intoxicating drink in the
constitution. the framers recognized it as such but then equated with intoxicating liquor again becomes
a little difficult.
now, my lord. now that you've formulated, now let's go to the legislative history, and
then the few places you want to start.
i think maybe by lunch, we should be done with your submission by then.
about an hour and seven minutes.
i don't think, it has taken nearly hour and a half to elaborate on the
entries over here.
now what is the gist of the point?
now, we just rapid fire with your.
we're supporting your submissions.
i would only request is, it's an important issue.
then where rapid fire may lead or may lead to leaving out something which is
important.
and that is what happens.
the rapid fire happened in synthetics too, as a consequence of which lots of things
didn't come there.
mister dwivedi, the chief justice has to always say that, not because it's going to
be enforced but because the clock on the other side constantly stares at us.
at the very initial state, i had said if your lordships are going to determine
this scope of the argument in terms of timeline, then perhaps, i will have lots
of difficulty.
in lines now because there's so much of work.
so many.
no, but for such an issue which is there rankling since nineteen fifty one.
this is an issue decided for the first time in ' fifty one and since
then it continued for thirty eight.
the reason for the reference and everything is not because it is so complex or
something, but because perceptions change.
our perception of what india is today is very different from the perception which judges
had in nineteen fifty or nineteen sixty.
there's a new dimension to states right as federalism has progressed.
a lot of reasons why we continually look, re-look at our judgments.
there are two answers to it, there are two answers to it.
so there are written submissions now, directly.
yes, yes.
but before that, there are two answers to it.
federalism concept is to my aid.
the other thing is the evolution takes place, new things are discovered, new things happen.
but then what lordships have said that the legislative entries must be interpreted in an
expansive manner to include the new things and new situations.
but that doesn't mean that the old gets lost.
the old will be there, plus additionally, this will come.
submission. yes. and see how you are first and foremost saying that entry eight covers
intoxicating liquor.
that's the first major submission, which you have, and the second is in the alternative.
now, kindly come to my written submissions.
volume i(a), page two.
page two.
at the bottom, lordship would notice there is a word, 'intoxicating liquor' under eight, list
ii. have lordships got?
'it is important to note that the word industrial alcohol, iowa for short, is nowhere
used in any of the lists. entry eight, list ii only uses the phrase intoxicating
liquor, which has a rich and deep history and the legislative practice accompanying it.
it is therefore, relevant to notice the history behind this phrase.
it has been repeatedly held that the legislative entries are fields of legislation and therefore'.
.
my lordships, this principle is well known.
but the first principle is well known, so i need not take your lordships' time.
then that second aspect is also well known.
then the third aspect, the important part in this is, that there is a necessity
starts with the context, contextual interpretation out of necessity starts with historical perspective, particularly, the
legislative practice.
that is what we call legal sense.
now there, there is one decision which i really wanted to place before your lordship,
if your lordship would permit?
(nineteen fifty nine) one scr three hundred and seventy nine and the relevant pages are.
nineteen fifty nine?
' fifty nine, volume i scr three hundred and seventy nine, age three hundred and
ninety to three hundred and ninety one.
then three hundred and ninety seven to four hundred and thirteen.
this decision is not fifty one.
one scr is in volume v(b), page four hundred and eighty one.
pdf page four hundred and eighty six.
volume v(b)?
v(b).
my lord, the reason why i want to cite this judgment this is.
v(b).
on what proposition do you cite it?
yes. in this case, the real dispute was with regard to tax on sale of
goods.
so, question arose, what is the meaning of the term, 'sale of goods' as understood
by the framers or the lawmakers?
this was a case under nineteen thirty five act, therefore, the entry was the same.
they said what is.
so, what were they told?
their lordships, not debated the question whether we should adopt the popular sense or the
common-sense point of view with respect to legislative entry, or we should adopt a sense
which is in conformity with the legislative practice, which they call the legal sense.
and eventually, after considering everything and lots of judgments, both the us supreme court in
british matters, privy counsel and all, they came to the conclusion that the real meaning
can be derived after looking into the legal history, that is the legal sense, not
the popular sense.
that's not always correct.
from legal history, yes.
how this have been used even before the adoption of that entry in.
because what they said a lot of.
government of india. quite right.
and what their lordship said.
that your lordships would have to sit in the position of the framers and see
what the law was and in what sense.
mister dwivedi, i don't think we need to labour that point really.
let's go.
this is what i wanted to rely on this.
this is absolutely perfect.
and ' fifty one therefore, supreme court scr, the one above balasara. this is (nineteen
fifty one) scr, six hundred and eighty two.
yes. this is balsara versus state of bombay or state of bombay versus balsara. where
do we find it in the volumes?
volume v(b)?
volume v(b).
v(b), right?
volume v. volume v. page seventeen eighteen.
and what does it say?
i mean, you can just formulate it for us.
in balsara, the question of course, the case was with regard to potable liquor.
yes. but they considered the history of the term, 'intoxicating liquor'.
i think balsara, we may have to look at.
yes. they consider the entire history of intoxicating liquor from the british position to government
of india because government of india has an act of british parliament. i think balsara
we may see, no.
it's regarding portable liquor.
and then this intoxicating liquor would include all kinds of liquors, including industrial alcohol. i
know there is a difficulty.
i have it in scr form.
your lordships have it, perhaps in air form.
now, everybody should cite scr because we have a digi scr in place now.
quite right.
so, i have it in the scr form your lordships have.
it is nineteen fifty one.
thirty two?
scr. nineteen fifty one scr, page six hundred and eighty two.
you can load it for us on the digi scr. you can load it on
the screen.
that's the official report.
yes, you know you have given scr online.
and this further went to the extent of saying even in medicinal preparations containing alcohol
would come under intoxicating liquor.
which are the relevant paragraphs?
yes, but actually i am from scr, i can give you lots of relevant pages,
but i can't give the relevant.
can you just load it for us on our screen so that we can both
follow, both the.
woh kar lo.
digi scr kar lo.
it has to go to?
yes. kindly notice the question here which arose, page six hundred and eighty five and
six hundred and eighty six.
question is with regard to, obviously, as i said, it was against the direction of
the prohibition commissioner of bombay prohibiting.
so, where do you want us to go to now?
kindly have the next page, six hundred and eighty six.
the second paragraph.
the act in question was passed by the legislature of the province of bombay. this
was an act under government of india act, nineteen forty nine act. therefore, government of
india act and the entry was entry thirty one which is in the same terms
as entry eight.
which page do you want us to go to now?
look go where they discuss liquor and intoxicating liquor.
that's page seven hundred and three.
'the high court has held that the word, liquor'.
, starts like that.
before that lordship may have a look at the entry.
entry thirty one is at page six hundred and ninety.
it says entry thirty one, list ii. intoxicating liquors and narcotic drugs, that is to
say, production, manufacturer, possession, transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors, opium so and so.
we are not concerned with opium, but 'intoxicating liquor' was the word they have used.
now coming to page seven hundred and three and this law was claimed to have
been made under entry thirty one, list ii of the government of india act nineteen
thirty five.
slightly above this is the definition of 'liquor'.
oxford english dictionary. earlier just slightly earlier.
liquor includes spirit of wine, etcetera.
just above this paragraph starting from, 'high court has held'.
'the high court has held that the word'.
.
may i?
but in the bombay act, perhaps, there was the definition of the word, liquor which
included spirits of wine, with ethylated spirit and all liquids consisting of alcohol.
then the answer is given by the high court, which is page seven hundred and
three.
'the high court has held that the word liquor, ordinarily, means a strong drink as
opposed to soft drink, but it must, in any event, be a beverage which is
ordinarily drunk.
proceeding upon this view, the high court has held that, although, the legislature may while
legislating under entry thirty one prevent the consumption of non-intoxicating beverages and also prevent the
use as drinks of alcoholic liquids which are not normally consumed as drinks, it cannot
prevent the legislature the legitimate use of alcoholic preparations, which are not beverages, nor the
use of medicinal toilet preparations containing alcohol.
this view of the high court was very strongly supported in the one hand and
equally strongly challenged on the other, before us.
and i therefore, proceed to deal'.
now then, your lordships go to the dictionary meaning.
in the oxford english dictionary, edited by james murray, several meanings are given to the
word, liquor, of which the following may be quoted.
liquor, a liquid matter in a liquid state, in wider sense a fluid.
a liquid or a prepared solution used as a wash or bath and in many
processes in the industrial parts.
liquid for drinking beverage drink, now, almost exclusively a drink produced by a fermentation or
distillation, malt liquor, liquor brewed from malt, ale, beer, water etcetera.
the water in which meat has been boiled, both sauce, the fat in which bacon,
fish or the like has been fried, the liquid containing.
the liquid produced by infusion.
my lordship, may i omit the rest and come to the next page?
thus, according to the dictionary, the word, liquor may have a general meaning in the
sense of a liquid, or it may have a special meaning, which is the third
meaning assigned to it in the extract quoted above.
vis-a-vis a drink or beverage produced by fermentation or distillation.
the latter is, undoubtedly, the popular and the most widely accepted meaning of the and
the basic idea of beverage seems rather prominent to run through the main provisions of
the various acts of this country, as well as america and england relating to intoxicating
liquor to which our attention was drawn.
but at the same time on the reference to these very acts, it is difficult
to hold that they deal exclusively with beverages and are not applicable to certain articles
which are, strictly speaking, not beverages.
a few instances will make the point clear.
in the national prohibition act nineteen oh nine of america, the word liquor and intoxicating
liquor are used as having the same meaning and the definition states that these words
shall be construed to include alcohol, brandy, whiskey, rum, gin, bear, ale, potter wine.
and in addition, there to any spirituous malt or fermented liquor, liquid and compounds, whether
medicated, proprietary, proprietary patented or not and by whatever name called, containing one half of
one percent of more or more of alcohol by volume which are fit for use
as beverage purpose.
having defined liquor intoxicating liquor rather widely, the volstead act accepted denatured alcohol, medicinal preparations,
toilet and antiseptic preparations, flavouring extracts and syrups, vinegar and preserved sweet cider which suggests
that they were included in the definition.
in some of these items, we have the qualifying words unfit for use for beverage
purposes.
but the heading of the section four of volstead act under which these exceptions are
enumerated, the exempted liquors'.
mister dwivedi, if you go to para forty.
i mean, we are in para forty four, which says coming now to the various
definitions.
middle of that para.
yes. if you go to middle of that para, even if, we exclude the american
and english acts from our consideration, we find that all the provincial acts of this
country have consistently included liquids containing alcohol in the definition of liquor, an intoxicating liquor.
may i place it to your lordship?
yeah, you can just read from there.
'even if we'.
'in the bengal excise act'.
no, no, no the para is, 'coming now to the various definitions'.
alright. 'coming down to the'.
middle of that para.
middle of the para.
correct, correct.
i have it.
'even if we', 'even if we'.
'coming now to the definition'.
just skip that.
'even if we exclude the american, english acts'.
that's the ratio.
but kindly have it from report my lord, because it refers to the local act.
not necessary.
the formulation is, even if we exclude the american that's what we are relying on.
no, they were relying upon indian acts too earlier.
that's not necessary now.
just go to 'even if we'.
'even if we exclude the american and english acts from our consideration, we find that
all the provincial acts of this country have consistently included liquids containing alcohol in the
definition of liquor and intoxicating liquor.
the framers of the government of india act nineteen thirty five could not have been
entirely ignorant of the accepted sense in which the word liquor has been used in
the various excise acts of this country, and accordingly, i consider the appropriate conclusion to
be that the word liquor covers not only those alcoholic liquids which are generally used
for beverage purposes and produce intoxication, but also, all liquids containing alcohol'.
it may be that the latter meaning is not the meaning which is attributed to
the word 'liquor' in common parliament, especially when that word is prefixed by the qualifying
word 'intoxicating'.
but in my opinion, i think regards to the numerous statutory definitions of the word
such a meaning could not have been intended to be excluded from the scope of
the term 'intoxicating liquor' used in entry thirty one of list ii. my lord, this
is entry thirty one is entry eight of the constitution. is entry eight.
now my lord, to kind of corroborate this reasoning, if your lordship, would come to
my written submissions.
i have extracted all the definitions of liquor in the local acts. and these are
all of i think nineteen fifty one.
do you have more on this judgment that you want to or this is the
point you want to make?
that's the point which i have.
okay, then we will close this judgement now.
what is the next point?
no, kindly come to the page eight of my written submissions.
alright, we will.
there i have extracted the definitions of liquor, intoxicating liquor, alcoholic liquor and so on
so forth, but lot flows from that.
page eight of my written submissions.
page eight.
yes. so, these are the backdrops under basis of which entry thirty one of government
of india act was enacted and that was borrowed by the constitution. page eight.
first is bombay abkari act eighteen seventy eight.
liquor includes spirits of wine with highlighted spirit which is not potable, it's poisonous.
my lord. spirits, spirits is defined later on, my lord, i'll show that.
means 'any liquor containing alcohol and obtained by distillation, whether it is denatured or not',
that's the important part.
so, they were quite conscious of the fact that there is something like denatured spirit
which is not potable.
and then section three hundred and fifty, lordships, may have little below that, excisable article
uses the phrase, because excise able article means and includes, any liquor or intoxicating drink
as herein defined.
then my lord, madras akbari act again, 'spirit means any liquor containing alcohol and obtained
by distillation, whether it is denatured or not'.
then kindly turnover to the next page thirty nine, definition of word 'liquor'.
'liquor includes spirits of wine, methylated spirits, spirits, wine, toddy, beer and all liquids consisting
of or containing alcohol'.
then excisable article.
'any alcoholic liquor for human consumption'.
now my lord, the distinction is made here from 'liquor' and 'alcoholic liquor for human
consumption' for tax purpose.
then this is followed in the next act also, the bengal act. 'any liquor for
human consumption, excisable article, any liquor for human consumption, it follows the same pattern'.
and then my lord, it defines in section two, intoxicant means any liquor.
lordship may leave the rest.
kindly see section two hundred and fourteen, 'liquor', means liquid consisting of or containing alcohol
and includes spirits of wine, spirits, wine, taadi, bachwai, don't go over the rest.
section two hundred and nineteen, 'spirit' means any liquor containing alcohol obtained by distillation, whether
it is denatured or not'.
then bihar act follows the same pattern.
these are around the same vintage, excisable article, any alcoholic liquor for human consumption.
section two hundred and fourteen defines liquor, includes all liquids consisting or containing alcohol and
then spirit means any liquor containing alcohol obtained by distillation, whether it is denatured or
not.
then comes the mp excise act, which is same vintage, the same pattern.
alcoholic liquor for human consumption so far as the excise duty is concerned.
liquor defined widely includes all spirits, all liquids consisting or containing alcohol and then spirit
is defined as widely, including denatured spirit also.
so spirit is part of liquor and the denatured spirit is also part of liquor.
likewise, when we come to punjab act which applied to delhi, haryana, himachal pradesh and
all these.
here, there is an interesting thing which comes in now.
section two hundred and fourteen,' liquor means intoxicating liquor and includes all liquids consisting of
or containing alcohol'.
omit the rest, my lord. 'spirit means any liquor containing alcohol obtained by distillation, whether
denatured or not'.
so in other words, even denatured spirit was part of intoxicating liquor and liquor means
intoxicating liquor.
both are equated.
then the same pattern is followed in the chhattisgarh act of nineteen fifty.
for tax purpose, alcoholic liquor for human consumption is used.
section two hundred and thirteen defines liquor.
'liquor means intoxicating liquor and includes spirits of wine, spirit, all liquids consisting or containing
alcohol'.
then spirit is defined to include even denatured spirit.
again, my lords, up excise act of the same vintage, follows the same pattern, exactly
the same pattern.
your contention is that all liquid containing alcohol.
was part of intoxicating liquor.
.is part of intoxicating liquor.
and not only that, with due respect, my lords may see that page seven of
my written submissions.
pdf page eight.
there is something more to be said.
and i'm only basing this on the fact that we have followed the government of
india act nineteen thirty five, which is an act of british parliament. so therefore, the
pattern and thinking would be the same as it was there and if in thirty
one that was the concept, then that has to be the same in the constitution,
because framers adopted the same.
now, the legislative, may i place it?
the legislative.
page seven of my written submissions 'the legislative practice leads us to british position and
therefore to laws prevailing, therein.
license consolidation act of nineteen ten, section one hundred and ten, spirits act nineteen ten,
section three, four, five and six '.
now, the license consolidation act not uses the term 'spirit' as well as 'intoxicating liquor'
for licensing.
then, these excise acts have come.
mister dwivedi, the liquor will include all liquid containing alcohol.
no doubt about it.
because when the legislature or the constitution uses the expression 'liquor', it means all liquid
containing alcohol.
but when the word 'liquor' is qualified by the word 'intoxicating', does that make any
difference to that?
exactly, my lord. this is what.
no, does intoxicating liquor also mean all liquor containing alcohol, which would include all liquids
containing denatured spirit, also?
that's your contention.
yes, because every liquid containing alcohol is included as intoxicating liquor.
intoxicating liquor means liquor.
liquor means intoxicating liquor, that is evident from the pattern of these acts.
when. no, but liquor by itself would mean any liquid containing alcohol.
sorry?
any intoxicating.
my lord, what, perhaps, is pointed out is that, perhaps, there can be a drug
in a liquid form which may be intoxicative.
so therefore, it can be a liquid containing intoxicant.
the word 'intoxicant' was wider.
intoxicating does not mean that it has to be capable of human consumption.
it indicates the potentiality of the item, that there is alcohol in it and therefore,
it is intoxicating.
it can mean both, something had as it is, as well as, as a beverage
or as well as liquid containing alcohol, because that is intoxicated.
my lord, once let's take the instance of the country liquor.
a country liquor is extremely common all around the world, in most of the states
and is the highest revenue churner in the states, perhaps.
now, what is country liquor?
if i may place before your lordships, that chart we had prepared to explain to
your lordships the term 'intoxicating liquor'?
rectified spirit.
actually, the base is the rectified spirit.
lord, he's.
lord, in the most convenient form, we have tried to explain the process that will
help in understanding of the commodity with which we are dealing.
mister dwivedi, can we sort of.
you are showing us the definitions of the excise act, various states.
so, as the chief justice just said, all liquid containing alcohol will come within that.
now, whether it brings joy to the human, it must bring joy to the revenue.
is that what you're trying to say?
it does bring quite a joy to the revenue my lord, because most of the
states would try to apply, prohibition failed and had to reverse their policies.
so, it is really joyous for the state to have, and liquor is really flogged
as the most avenue generating device.
there's no doubt about in our country.
and therefore, every state wants to control it.
but the important part is your lordship will see, the chart which we have indicated,
the process of manufacturing spirit.
'it is a heavy, dark coloured, viscous liquid, molasses, because that's the basic raw material,
molasses.
it is the heavy, dark coloured, viscous liquid produced in the final stage of manufacturing
of sugar and it is the byproduct in the sugar industry and raw material for
the manufacturing of alcohol'.
now how does it happen?
fermentation. 'firstly, the viscous liquid obtained from the sugar industry is mixed with water and
yeast.
it is also added to convert the fermentable sugars present in the molasses into alcohol.
but the process of fermentation, a saccharine solution is obtained which is also known as
fermented wash.
in the fermented wash of paint during this process only ten to eleven percent alcohol
is generated in the total volume.
fermented wash is conveyed from the wash backs to the stilts columns in closed pipes.
in the process of separating ethyl alcohol from the fermented wash and in this process,
various components of the mixture are separated by virtue of their difference in boiling points.
during the process of distillation, impurities like acetaldehyde, fused oil, impure spirits which are not
fit for human consumption are removed.
the product comes to be rectified spirit having strength of ninety one percent to ninety
five percent after the process of distillation'.
now, this is my lord, ethyl spirit or the rectified spirit, as we call it.
redistillation. 'in order to further remove the impurities, the redistillation is done.
after redistillation, the product comes to be extra neutral alcohol having strength of ninety five
percent to ninety seven percent volume by volume, meaning thereby out of one hundred litres
of ena, ninety five percent to ninety seven is alcohol.
this distilled liquor can be aged or unaged to produce potable alcohol.
for aged distilled liquor, maturation is required.
for unaged distilled liquor, no maturation is required.
vodka, gin, country liquor are examples where maturation is not required.
this fact really shows that the liquor before maturation is also fit for human consumption'.
now there are two columns my lord, the maturation.
'for maturing of imfl, indian made foreign liquor, maturation is only to improve the quality
of alcohol and in this process, ena is stored in the wooden wax for the
period of one year or two years or five years, ten years, twelve years and
eighteen years in which chemical changes occur during storage, as the spirit in the container
moves back and forth through the wood.
the ingredients, including flavouring compounds are extracted from the wood and carried back into the
container's contents on its own'.
now their column is my lords, will see the rectified spirit which i was talking
to.
'after distillation nor redistillation, the extra neutral alcohol becomes fit for human consumption.
one is required to add only demineralized water into ena having strength of ninety five
percent to ninety seven percent volume by volume.
in india, country liquor is manufactured simply by adding demineralized water essence plus caramel into
the ena to bring its strength to twenty five percent '.
so, you dilute it, because it can't be had as it is, it will really
burn your intestines.
to bring its strength to twenty five percent volume by volume for plain country spirit
and to thirty six percent for manufacturing of spice country spirit, for preparation of whether,
this is important my lord. 'since ena is fit for human consumption, it is also
used for the purposes of preparation of medicines'.
nowadays, what is interesting is to see there are liquors of all kinds which are
potable, like for instance, whiskeys and vodkas and all that.
they go up to seventy two percent, fifty seven, sixty percent, seventy two percent.
recently i discovered potable liquor consisting of ninety two percent.
so as your lordship said, as the time passes, new things come in, new concepts
emerge.
people keep on experimenting.
they want the strongest drink possible.
therefore, they get it.
the second aspect of it is important, if your lordships would turn to the page
seven of my written submissions.
because there are blended whiskeys, there are single malts.
addition of demineralized water, the reduction of spirit dilution.
'addition of demineralized water in the alcohol is done to bring the higher strength to
lower strength.
in the case of indian made foreign liquor by adding demineralized water's strength of ninety
percent, v/v to ninety seven volts per volt is brought down to forty two percent.
and the desired strength as per the norms'.
then it is bottled.
i need not go into that.
but the basic idea is to.
i'm sorry.
now my lord, so far as.
page seven.
but before that, the term 'potability', which is now being used with regard to entry
eight.
potability is a relative concept.
potability can mean something had as it is, like intoxicating drink.
we have a peg of whiskey or a vodka or something like that.
that's intoxicating drink and potable.
that's one aspect of potability.
the other aspect of potability is that you add something to it and you diffuse
it and then make it drinkable.
how much you want to reduce and diffuse the strength of the liquor is, that
is as per your choice.
but it is something which is fit for human consumption?
potable liquor?
potable liquor can mean both.
this is what i'm saying, that it is fit for consumption as it is, or
maybe after putting in something into it and then making it consumable.
that is my.
as opposed to industrial alcohol. but industrial alcohol can be used for industrial purpose also,
like producing chemicals.
industrial alcohol is not potable.
as it is, it is not.
but then rectified spirit of ninety five percent or ninety four percent, by just adding
water, you are reducing the strength of the rectified spirit and having it.
unless, of course, it is denatured.
denatured means when you are adding an item into it, which perhaps makes it nauseous
and of course, poisonous.
really, the word 'intoxicating' does not really mean that it has to be fit for
human consumption.
absolutely. it's an alcohol in which.
it's a liquid in which alcohol is being added.
you're relying on the legislative history which was referred to in balsara's case one and
second, that the constitution when it wanted to use related to alcohol fit for human
consumption, it did so in entry eighty four of list i and entry fifty one
of list ii. entry eight is designedly only intoxicating liquors and therefore, intoxicating cannot be
conflated with fit for human consumption, according to you.
and i will be repeating myself.
after all, lordships, have always held in so many decisions that why use two different
phrases for denoting the same thing?
once different phrases are used, then obvious intention is that it denotes something different.
and so widely different.
now, the other thing which i wanted to emphasize on is, please notice this.
government of india act comes in nineteen thirty five and for the first time it
uses the word intoxicating liquor.
entry thirty one it has entry forty which again, is parallel to entry fifty one,
list ii. this is okay.
so, the government of india act of nineteen thirty five.
for the first time in india use the phrase, not in the constitutional statute, the
word, intoxicating liquor comes in entry thirty one.
and it's in the same form as entry eight, like the framers have borrowed it
from there.
and at the same time, they use same phraseology as in entry fifty one, list
ii, alcoholic liquor for human consumption, in entry forty, which is excise duty.
same as fifty one, list ii. can you say that again?
my lord, in entry forty, the same phraseology as in entry fifty one, list ii,
alcoholic liquor for human consumption, has been used.
when i had placed the local acts as forming the backdrop, surely the makers of
the government of india act were aware of those local acts. their own liquor licensing
act, which used the term intoxicating liquor.
their spirit act of eighteen seventy which used both denatured as well as.
it was used for licensing in the intoxicating liquor act of nineteen ten.
i have indicated that in page seven this aspect.
page seven to eight.
but an interesting factor, which i wanted to bring to your lordship's notice in this
regard is this.
when government of india act entry thirty one uses the same phraseology as the local
acts, intoxicating liquor, then obviously, it had in mind that intoxicating liquor, which was defined
in most of the local acts. that has been borrowed in the constitution of india,
obviously, it follows the same thing.
now, in entry eight, the word intoxicating liquor, is there they have followed that.
in entry fifty one or entry forty, list ii of the government of india act
and entry fifty one, list ii of the constitution, they have followed the same pattern
as in.
entry eighty four, list i. entry eighty four.
first it is entry fifty one, list ii in the state list and then the
extruded part goes to entry fifty four, list i. entry eighty four, list i, as
in.
i'm sorry, entry eighty four.
but then you see entry eight list ii, is not a taxing entry.
but entry fifty one, list ii is a taxing entry.
quite right.
so, we are not in the.
issue is not tax here.
issue is the regulatory power, licensing powers.
so, what i am saying is, again, my lord, it corroborates my viewpoint that taxing
entry cannot be used to curtail the.
no, we are entitled to levy a tax.
no, no i'm not.
you say that i'm entitled to regulate under entry eight.
and as incidental to the regulation, i can impose a fees under entry sixty six
of list ii. i am not even for a moment claiming that we have a
power to impose tax on denatured spirit or perhaps industrial alcohol. no, we don't have.
entry eighty four is clear.
yes. and there is no taxing entry other than entry fifty one, list ii in
the state list, so we can't.
it hardly matters, it doesn't make much of a difference because liquor is nothing but
a good denatured spirit would be a good.
it can be taxes, sales tax.
likewise it is a good it can be taxed under entry fifty two, that is
entry tax earlier.
so, it's not that we can't tax denatured spirit or something.
it can be taxed in other forms, that is sales tax, entry tax and other
local taxes.
that can be done.
but of course, state by itself cannot tax it as an excise duty.
that power is not a way.
to say there is no power to tax industrial alcohol is not correct, with due
respect.
it is correct to say that we do not have the power to impose excise
duty on industrial alcohol, that is correct.
in fact, after synthetics, synthetics clearly held in paragraph eighty six my lord that state
will not have power to impose sales or purchase tax once idr is there.
that had to be clarified by synthetics third case.
yes. my lord, that doesn't deal with sale and purchase tax.
therefore, it couldn't be held to be law on that.
laying down law on that.
so, interesting part of what i'm saying is if the government of india act when
it followed excisable article by specifying alcoholic liquor for human consumption and incorporated that in
entry forty, and it continued to follow intoxicating liquor and put it in entry thirty
one, then obviously, they were seeing the difference.
and therefore, for separate things, they were incorporating it in a separate phraseology.
we can't mix up entry fifty one, list ii and say it kind of restricts
entry eight because that's a taxing entry, this is a regulatory entry, and both lordships,
have held in so many cases, separate.
so, taxing entry cannot colour the regulatory entry just as regulatory entry cannot lead to
enforcement of imposing of tax.
so, it would be quite unimaginable to think that the government of india, framers of
government of india act and the constitution partly followed the local laws and they did
not follow the local laws in other respect, that doesn't make sense.
then please complete the submission.
.
yes. my lord, there is also a word called, 'alcoholic liquor' in entry fifty one,
list ii. your lordships, have seen.
right. alcoholic liquor obviously is very wide.
therefore, they divide it by saying, for consumption.
consumption. and if we read the definitions in the local acts, it contains all liquids
consisting of alcohol which would be alcoholic liquor.
so therefore, intoxicating liquor.
liquor means intoxicating liquor and contains all liquids consisting of alcohol, obviously means alcoholic liquor.
now, for instance, entry fifty four, after the one hundred first amendment says taxes on
alcoholic liquor for human consumption.
yes. so, state doesn't have the power to tax the industrial alcohol. that is, it
can only tax, impose tax in respect of alcoholic liquor for human consumption.
but that does not, as i said, mean that state cannot impose any tax on
industrial alcohol. it can sales tax.
it can entry tax.
i mean, after all, industrial alcohol is nothing but goods.
the entry tax says goods brought in for sale and consumption, for use.
so it's not correct to say that, the entire field of taxation goes.
let's look at your submissions so that we then conclude that part.
page seven, i was placing, and i would pray, kindly permit me to place the
entire page.
and this, this one page only.
'the legislative practice leads us to british position, therefore to laws prevailing therein, license cons'.
.
page number?
the written submission, i have placed in page seven.
i'm sorry, there seems to be some confusion.
we got it.
we got pdf page seven, bottom.
'the legislative practice leads us to british position and therefore, to laws prevailing therein'.
license consolidation act nineteen nineteen, as i already told your lordships, includes the word 'intoxicating
liquor'.
b) spirits act, nineteen eighty, which includes the denatured spirit.
spirit act defined spirit very widely to cover both potable and non-potable liquor.
section three to five and sixteen.
it deals with manufacture, distillation, detailing, etcetera.
of spirits.
while licensing act of nineteen ten deals with licensing of distribution.
word 'intoxicating liquor' is defined there to include spirit of all kinds, including fermented and
distilled.
british position is clear that intoxicating liquor includes all kinds of spirits.
the later nineteen ten act used this term compendiously to include all spirits, all kinds
of spirits, while spirit under eighteen eighty act included liquor of all kinds.
thus, in england, both the terms were understood and used interchangeably.
that's what, my lord, the lordship would notice, balsara says.
it notices these two acts. then the government of india act nineteen fifteen, section forty
five, seventy nine to eighty one, 'the devolution rules made under section forty five (a)
and section one hundred twenty nine of government of india act nineteen fifteen, distinguished the
functions in jurisdictions of local governments and that of the governor general or the indian
legislature. the subjects have been classified as central or provincial subjects.
part two of the schedule i of the rules mentions item sixteen as excise and
alcoholic liquor.
it is around this time and thereabout, various state in actants were framed pertaining to
the alcoholic liquors'.
what is important to notice is, right from the earliest position, the local laws, the
government of india act and so on and so forth, the state had the complete
control and jurisdiction of intoxicating liquor.
earlier under the government of india act nineteen fifteen, even the excise duty in respect
of entire intoxicating liquor was with the state, which was separated for the first time
in government of india act nineteen thirty five, where industrial alcohol was put in the
can of union and in the can of the state.
that was the position and it was in the light of this position, leaving the.
the extracts of local laws.
kindly come to para twelve.
page twelve.
page?
page twelve. twelve.
page twelve of my written submissions.
volume one (a).
'in all the state laws, where liquor and spirit are defined as including all liquids
containing alcohol.
in some acts, word intoxicant, is used to define liquor as comprising of all liquids
containing alcohol.
additionally, in some local act, liquor means intoxicating liquor and includes all liquids containing alcohol.
it is also noticeable that all the local acts were alive and aware and aware
of industrial alcohol and denatured spirit.
being integral part of spirit or liquor.
reading all the above definitions, it becomes apparent that excise, liquor and spirits have always
been part of state jurisdictions, including industrial alcohol. centre did not have any jurisdiction in
this regard.
the legislatures were always aware of the industrial use of the alcohol and the local
legislatures were dealing with.
liquor and spirit, traditionally, included all liquids consisting alcohol.
industrial alcohol is a liquid containing alcohol.
there cannot be any alcohol or liquor which does not cause intoxication.
therefore, any liquid containing alcohol would be capable of causing intoxication.
it was in this sense word intoxicating liquor were defined.
intoxicating liquor only follows the past legislative history, for convenience, as part of the settled
vocabulary position, which it had come to denote'.
then, your lordships, will omit this one.
then on page fourteen, my lord, i'll just rushed through it.
page fourteen, the latter half.
'the importance of the legislative practice and past history can never be minimized.
this constitutes an important aspect of context as indicated above for determining the scope of
legislative power field, one has to have regard to what legislative practice it ordinarily embraces'.
and these are the four questions, my lord, four cases and then kindly add this
case.
(nineteen fifty nine) one scr three hundred and seventy nine, which i had referred to.
gannon dunkerley's case, which says that it is preferable to have legal sense rather than.
therefore, there would be a dichotomy, if your submission is correct.
namely, that the regulatory power over industrial alcohol would vest to the states.
but insofar as the taxing power is concerned, the taxing power over industry goes to
the centre. but again, my lord, if i may remind lordships, the difference is when
we talk of taxing power, excise duty is not the only tax.
it's a tax on manufacture only.
but then rest of the tax state can impose, like sales tax, entry tax and
other local taxes.
yes. so, these are the cases where i had, my lord. but then the important
aspect here again is, my lord, let us fall back on the question state and
the union claims or the synthetics says entry fifty two, is the source of power
to regulate industrial alcohol, exclusive power.
then, as i pointed out, my lord, then that source leads us to entry twenty
four.
now, if industry word includes industrial alcohol and intoxicating liquor means something else then with
due respect, does not taking the past into consideration, it doesn't make sense.
if the power had to be given to the state originally, if the power had
to vest in the state under entry twenty four, then i possibly can't imagine why
the framers would have not put it in entry eight rather than entry twenty four,
which is a general vague entry.
to be searched and traced by your lordships through legal arguments and dictionaries and things
like that.
i mean, framers had not enumerated the lists in a very carefully planned and perhaps
elaborate manner.
why would they commit this kind of a confusion?
so therefore, to trace intoxicating i mean, to trace industrial alcohol to entry fifty two
would be absolutely illogical.
that apart, my lord, may again.
i'll come to what fell from lord justice chandrachud. why not entry ninety seven?
entry ninety seven is a residuary entry, which is supposed to be used in the.
there is no other state list entry or so.?
first thing we have to see is whether there is a state entry or any
entry in the concurrent.
entry or a concurrent list entry.
so, if in list ii and iii, if there is any entry which can logically
trace this within itself, then entry ninety seven cannot be used.
but then there's even other difficulty your lordships, would notice.
if the union traces it to entry fifty two, then obviously for that reason also,
entry ninety seven cannot be used, because then it falls in entry twenty four.
an intoxicating liquor and industrial alcohol would be in entry twenty four, basically and it
can be drawn over to entry fifty two.
so, this again my lord, reduces our difficulty for placing it in entry ninety seven.
it can't go to entry ninety seven because it has been traced to fifty two.
fifty two means twenty four, which means state list. see, entry twenty four is subject
to list, entry fifty two of list i. suppose it is declared industry under entry
fifty two, list i, it can be any industry which is declared by the parliament?
no, that's a difficulty.
it can only be that industry which is in entry twenty four.
so, entry twenty four cannot include an industry which falls in entry twenty five.
that is also an industry and i'll cite two, three cases on that that will
clarify it.
the first decision which comes to mind is calcutta gas nineteen sixty two.
now, what is the meaning to be given to entry fifty two, list i?
yes. that cannot be curtailed.
on the principle of what is called a parliamentary supremacy, having regard to article two
hundred and forty six of the constitution. i will answer that.
my lord, first and foremost, we'll have to demarcate the fields.
now, when we go to demarcating the fields, we look at entry fifty two, list
i. now entry fifty two, list i uses the word 'industry'.
there can be a declaration by parliament with regard to an industry.
now, the obvious question, which i would like to answer is supposing there is no
declaration of parliament, and entry fifty two is not utilized, then where does this word
'industry' go?
it goes to entry twenty four.
so, there is an inherent link between entry twenty four and fifty two, and fifty
two only borrows from entry twenty four and not anything else.
so, when i'm placing it in entry eight, intoxicating liquor, then the union cannot take
it over because that's a plenary jurisdiction of the state independent of entry twenty four.
there are two.
really speaking your submissions boil down to two limbs.
first limb, that industrial alcohol falls within the ambit of entry eight of list ii.
if it falls within the ambit of entry eight of list ii, it's a specific
entry dealing with intoxicated liquors, therefore, it does not fall in entry twenty four of
list ii. since it does not fall in entry twenty four of list ii and
it is only entry twenty four of list ii which is subject to entry fifty
one, industrial alcohol is not subject to the overriding power of parliament under entry fifty
two of list i. that's one.
entry eight is not subject, right. that's one.
second, you say even assuming that industrial alcohol does not fall within the ambit of
entry eight of list ii then, in that event and assuming, arguing though that it,
falls under entry fifty two of list i, section eighteen-g contemplates that there has to
be a notified order, and in the absence of notified order, the subject is not
within the fold of parliament. it falls within entry thirty three of list iii. and
for this.
lordship is aware of tika ramji is the famous case where it says that.
tika ramji and then from there starting.
and declaration by parliament and the entry fifty two of list i notwithstanding, certain aspects
are taken over, certain subjects which would otherwise fall under entry fifty two have been
placed in entry thirty three of list iii. and therefore, the state power to regulate
under entry thirty three of list iii will include the power to levy a fee.
otherwise the consequence would be my lord, that all these entries eight, twenty five, they
all will be rendered new entry and empty by drawing power from idr act. now,
here would be, we'll be conferring parliament the jurisdiction to take away the preliminary powers
of the state legislature, which are not subject to, which are independent powers.
so, we can't adopt this.
even assuming that a declaration is issued by parliament under entry fifty two of list
i, notwithstanding that, it's evident from entry thirty three, that yet trade and commerce, production,
supply, distribution comes within entry thirty three, because entry thirty three, clause a covers only
those industries which are declared under entry fifty two of list i. and the other
thing is if your lordship would see, the calcutta gas is a constitution bench judgment.
the first case, where they considered this issue and they struck down idr on the
ground that you can't take over gas and gas works.
okay, we will come back after lunch.
now, mister dwivedi, i think now, we can wrap up in a short while, because
we have made very substantial progress i think we have understood your point.
now you can show us whatever remains in half an hour or so.
my lords, we've made so much of an effort.
kindly give us some more time.
oh yes, of course.
we will run through it.
pour in our efforts for us.
yes, yes, of course.
we'll look at the case law.
we'll run through now your written submissions and see what case law needs to be
looked at.
we have seen the essence of your submissions.
i'm grateful.
appreciating your lordship's concern for early finish, my lord, i certainly.
i'm sorry.
my lord, just one mentionable item, the chillness of the.
i'm sorry for that.
appreciating lordship's concern for early and fast finish, i have revised my argument in a
different way.
so, all that i would suggest now is just a recapitulation.
industrial alcohol must be understood in the context of the legal sense.
that is, the what it means is that it is part of intoxicating liquor.
if it is part of intoxicating liquor in entry eight, then it cannot be there
in entry twenty four, because the union's stand is only that it is there entry
twenty four drawn to entry fifty two.
so, all that we have to answer here is that it can't be in entry
twenty four.
intoxicating liquor in entry eight is not subject to unlike entry twenty four.
coming to this issue of paramountcy, my lord, we must take note of this fact,
paramountcy is a question which is resorted to only as an ultimate resort when the
conflict is there it cannot be resolved in any way.
otherwise, the rule of paramountcy is not applied.
what is applied is the issue of pith and substance, which your lordships have devised,
stating that the subjects will include the ancillary as well as the incidental factors which
can be legislated upon by the relevant legislature.
but this what your lordships have held is that incidental encroachment on the state list
can never imply reduction in state's jurisdiction.
it can at best save the law, which is in dispute but it cannot tantamount
to restricting the scope of the legislative entry, which is within the state jurisdiction or
state's legislative power, which is independent.
states are, in the federal polity, they are equally plenary, they are equally sovereign, sharing
the sovereignty.
so, we can't perhaps cut short state's power through parliamentary declarations that would be most
damaging for the federal structure.
because every time parliament legislates on its own subject and, incidentally, encroaches upon the state
list your lordships may hold it as valid applying the doctrine of pith and substance,
which means in substance they acted within its own list.
but if by that principle we are going to take away the power of the
state in respect of one entry which is independent, then imagine what will happen, my
lord, most of the cases, parliament will legislate on incidental and ancillary issues and it
will continue to prevail over the state's jurisdiction.
where will the.
ultimately, where will it go?
how far will it go?
so, that argument could be entirely destructive of the federal structure and should never be
adopted, that's what your lordships have always done, and i'll show the decisions.
but there also, your lordships have sounded a caveat that where the dominant legislature, that
is, the legislature in whose list the subject is; when the dominant legislature legislates, and
even if it conflicts with the incidental encroachment by the union, then the law made
by the dominant legislature will prevail.
yes. that is what justice ruma pal said in itc and that has been followed.
i'll give your lordship the reference of that judgment in (twenty eighteen), four scc seven
hundred and forty three paragraph thirty nine to forty three.
page?
i'll give the reference page number.
your lordships have time and again decried this fact that we must not adopt an
attitude which whittles down the state's power.
that's the word used right from perhaps nineteen ninety three, nine judges constitution bench. that
has been accepted right throughout up till now.
that word whittling down the state's power is 'anti-federal' has been accepted.
and this would be a classic case of whittling down the state's power under entry
fifty two, which is parliament's declaration.
that means parliament, by law, can take away the power of the state to regulate
some industry which is within its own exclusive sphere.
my lord, that decision is volume v(c), pdf page one.
let's see that, jayant verma. paragraph thirty nine to forty three.
paragraph thirty nine, which is pdf page thirty eight.
pdf page thirty nine.
it's my immaturity in this field perhaps exposes itself.
doesn't matter.
few more hearings like this and you'll be absolutely on track.
we must appreciate that you're making the effort that's really to be appreciated, honestly.
i'm grateful, my lord, but my problem is which is kind of a lurking suspicion,
what happens post november would we continue like this or not?
that's the issue.
once it becomes a part of your life, it becomes a part of your life.
imagine when we did three hundred and seventy, with the number of volumes and the
five judges, it would have taken thrice as much of time to resolve the article
three hundred seventy case, if we didn't have our computers.
five judges, here nine judges, nine court masters having to hand over individual volumes, multiple
volumes, every time something is cited, one really shudders about how this was done.
i mean, maybe earlier time so far as the employment situation in the country is
concerned, this would be anti-employment.
no, the court masters are all gainfully employed.
they're doing something else.
anyway, coming back to this, my lord, paragraph thirty nine.
yes shri bhushan then relied upon a concurring judgment of ranganathan, j. in federation of
hotels and restaurants association of india versus union of india. in paragraph seventy four, the
learned judge, while upholding the hotel receipts tax act, nineteen eighty held that, in pith
and substance, it was referable to entry eighty two, list i, being, in substance, a
tax on income.
in particular, shri bhushan relied upon the statement of the law that since parliament had
exclusive power, under article two hundred and forty six (one) and (three) of the constitution,
to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in list i, if
an act of parliament is squarely covered by an entry in the union list, no
restriction can be read into the power of parliament to make laws in regard thereto.
this was made in the context of a taxation entry, which as the aforesaid paragraph
seventy four itself states, refers to the constitutional scheme which neatly divides the subject matters
of tax between the union and the states, so that there can be said to
be no overlapping.
there is no discussion in this paragraph of parliamentary paramountcy in the context of incidental
trenching and unoccupied field.
this judgment, therefore, does not take the matter very much further.
insofar as article two hundred and forty six is concerned, we have already seen how
the said article refers to federal supremacy insofar as the whittling down of a state
list entry is concerned, when compared with a union list entry.
once the spheres of both the entries have been delineated, the doctrine of pith and
substance comes in to test whether a particular legislation is referable, as a whole, to
an entry in list i or to the competing entry in list ii. once it
is found that the legislation as a whole is referable to an entry in list
i, but it incidentally encroaches upon an entry in list ii, there is no reason
for the doctrine of unoccupied field not to apply to federal legislation.
the expression “with respect to” appears in all the sub-articles of article two hundred and
forty six, which expression, so far as clauses (one) to (three) are concerned, imports the
twin doctrines of incidental trenching and unoccupied field, which applies, therefore, to legislation made under
clauses (one) to (three) of article two forty six, thus making it clear that incidental
encroachment by parliament cannot be tolerated when the exclusive field allotted to the state legislature
is not occupied.
the paramountcy principle contained in article two hundred and forty six, as we have seen,
is only taken as a last resort after harmonious construction fails, and, that too, qua
entries in competing lists.
once legislation is referable to one list or the other, the doctrine of incidental trenching
and unoccupied field would apply equally to both parliamentary and state legislations.
in the very first judgment of the federal court, cp and berar sales of motor
spirit and lubricants taxation act, nineteen thirty eight in re air at page thirty one,
jayakar, j. set out principles that were evolved on a reading of the british north
america act by the privy council, which would prove to be a useful guide to
the construction of section one hundred of the government of india act, nineteen thirty five.
your lordship may leave that for a moment, these are principles which your lordships may
look into it but last clause which have been perhaps identified for.
even where there has been an endeavour to give pre-eminence to the central legislature in
cases of a conflict of powers, it is obvious that, in some cases where this
apparent conflict exists, the legislature could not have intended that powers exclusively assigned to the
provincial legislature should be absorbed in those given to the central legislature. kindly keep that
in mind.
then, my lord, they refer to paragraph forty two, the federal structure under the constitutional
scheme can also work to nullify an incidental encroachment made by the parliamentary legislation on
a subject of a state legislation where the dominant legislation is the state legislation.
an attempt to keep the aforesaid constitutional balance intact and give a limited operation to
the doctrine of federal supremacy can be discerned in the concurring judgment of ruma pal,
j. in itc ltd.v. agricultural produce market committee. this is a constitution bench, my lord,
wherein, after quoting the observations of this court in sr bommai, the learned judge had
gone to observe as follows, the fact that under the scheme of our constitution, greater
power is conferred upon the centre vis-à-vis the states does not mean that states are
mere appendages of the centre. my lord, may i pause here my lord, i recall
what your lordship had observed in the delhi matter, my lord, states are not satellites
and appendages of the centre. they have their own unique sphere, defined by the constitution.
within the sphere allotted to them, states are supreme.
the centre cannot tamper with their powers.
more particularly, the courts should not adopt an approach, an interpretation, which has the effect
of or tends to have the effect of whittling down the powers reserved to the
states. now, the next paragraph is equally important, my lord. yes. although parliament cannot legislate
on any of the entries in the state list, it may do so incidentally while
essentially legislating within the entries under the union list. conversely, the state legislatures may encroach
on the union list, when such an encroachment is merely ancillary to an exercise of
power intrinsically under the state list. the fact of encroachment does not affect the vires
of the law even as regards the area of encroachment.
this principle commonly known as the doctrine of pith and substance, does not amount to
an extension of the legislative fields.
therefore, such incidental encroachment in either event does not deprive the state legislature in the
first case or parliament in the second, of their exclusive powers under the entry so
encroached upon.
in the event the incidental encroachment conflicts with legislation actually enacted by the dominant power,
the dominant legislation will prevail.
otherwise, the entire concept would be anti-federal.
yes. what else?
now, what i was submitting here is and i'll run through it very fast.
i had already placed large portions of my written submission, but so far as it
is based on the legal history in the legal sense lordships can look into it.
my lord, i would not read the entire thing because it would be just repetition
of my.
page sixteen to twenty two and i have referred those principles which i have evolved
with case laws.
and this case law, which is specified point wise buttress is what i'm arguing.
but then eventually, what i would submit with respect is the last of these, page
twenty two, the last paragraph my lord, 'therefore, any declaration.
my lords have got it?
yes. therefore, any declaration under entry fifty two, list i, only draws jurisdiction from entry
twenty four, list ii, and cannot affect state legislature's power under any entry other than
entry twenty four, list ii. this is settled position by various constitution benches of this
court, entry twenty four is a general entry while special entry are excluded from it.
this is also settled by the above judgments, particularly the following: sixty two is a
very clear-cut case in this regard because it pertains to, as i had shown on
entry twenty five, list ii, gas and gas works.
idr took over that.
he said, you can't do that and they struck down.
likewise, my lord (nineteen eighty), four scc one hundred and thirty six.
this is a case ishwari khetan where issue was acquisition of a company read into
entry forty three, list iii. they said, entry fifty two cannot take over the power
from entry forty two, list iii. then (nineteen eighty one), four scc three hundred ninety
one, this is southern pharma, where again medicinal and toilet preparations were held to be
within intoxicating liquor as defined in balsara. medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol, they were
held to be within intoxicating liquor.
then my lord, (nineteen ninety six), three scc seven hundred and nine is extremely critical.
it considers this argument in detail and then holds that entry eight cannot be taken
over under entry fifty two.
now, of course, that case was a potable liquor.
but then what applies to potable liquor will equally apply to a non-potable liquor if
intoxicating liquor includes industrial alcohol.
so, this is direct authority which will help our cause.
and last of all, without wasting your lordship's time, i would pray kindly allow me
to place this judgment, (two thousand two), nine ssc two.
can we also see ninety six for a moment.
i mean, i think since you said it's very.
would your lordships like to see?
just for two minutes.
let's have a look at it.
volume v, pdf page twenty thirty six and paras are twenty five to thirty eight.
mister dwivedi, why are you going to your bound volume when it comes to the
cases.
you are going that far on your readings.
there's a slight kink in the mind that we underline it while reading.
so, when something comes without underlining, i feel absolutely lost.
we underline all the time over here when you are reading, because when you are
dictating the judgment.
i understand what your lordship is saying.
you'll be able to underline as well.
i'm sure your junior will tell you that little trick.
no, i have, my lord, i have all.
but even without the stylus, you can underline.
twenty thirty six volume v is it?
that is mcdowell. mcdowell. this is the case in relation to potable alcohol.
para?

para twenty five, pdf page is twenty fifty four.
twenty five to thirty eight.
this would also greatly answer justice nagarathna's problem that.
this will answer.
entries aforementioned disclose the following features.
they have referred to those entries, entry thirty three, fifty two.
your lordships will see in the earlier paragraph.
entry eight paragraph twenty three.
we may now notice the relevant entries in our constitution. entry six, eight, twenty four,
fifty one in list ii in the seventh schedule to the constitution read thus.
your lordships have already seen, so i will not waste much of time on that.
entry thirty three in list iii was substituted by constitution third amendment act, nineteen fifty
four.
the background to this entry is explained by this court in tika ramji versus state
of up entry thirty three of list iii reads trade and commerce in and production,
supply and distribution of (a) products of any industry where the control of such industry
by the union is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in the public
interest and imported goods of the same kind as such products; (b) food stuff, including
edible oil; (c) cattle fodder; (d) raw cotton, that we are not concerned with that.
but food stuff, your lordship may keep in mind, because i'll refer to that later
on.
the entries aforementioned disclose the following features.
the power to make a law with respect to industries lies with the states, entry
twenty four, list ii, but the said entry is made expressly subject to the provisions
of entry seven and fifty two in list i. it means that if parliament declares
by law that it is expedient, in public interest to take over the control of
a particular industry or industries.
such industry or industries get transplanted to list i. in other words, the industries in
respect to which parliament makes a declaration contemplated by entry fifty two in list i,
the states are denuded of the power to make any law with respect to them
under entry twenty four list ii. parliament has indeed made the declaration contemplated in entry
fifty two in list i. in section two of the idr act, which reads the
declaration as to the expediency of control by the union, it is hereby declared that
it is expedient in the public interest that the union should take under its control
the industries specified in the first schedule. by an amendment affected in ' fifty six,
first schedule was amended.
the amendment act inter alia introduced entry twenty six in the scheme.
it reads fermentation industry, alcohol and other products of the fermentation industry.
the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is based upon these provisions.
the submission is that manufacture and production of intoxicating liquor is an industrial activity falling
within item twenty six of the first schedule to the idr act. the idr act
provides for licensing of industries mentioned in the first schedule to the act besides providing
extensive control and regulation of such industries and their products.
the grant, the renewal and the refusal to grant or renew the license is thus
the exclusive province of the centre. the state has no say in the matter.
the state legislature is incompetent to prohibit manufacture of intoxicating liquors.
but this argument, in our opinion, ignores the existence and the ambit of entry eight,
list ii. entry eight expressly speaks of production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and sale of
intoxicating liquors.
it means that the power to make a law with respect to the said matters
rests with the state legislature. what is significant is that the entry speaks expressly of
production and manufacture of intoxicating liquors as well.
this would mean that the industries producing and manufacturing intoxicating liquors fall within the purview
of entry eight.
may i pause here?
your lordships must keep this in mind, that this judgment is under the shadows of
synthetics too.
it said that you don't have power in respect of industrial alcohol.
you can only regulate potable alcohol.
so it is under the shadow of that judgment that they are referring to.
applying the well-known rule of interpretation applicable to such situations (special excludes the general), we
must hold that the industries engaged in production and manufacture of intoxicating liquors do not
fall within entry twenty four, but do fall within entry eight.
this was the position at the commencement of the constitution, and this is the position
today as well.
once this is so, the making of a declaration by parliament as contemplated by entry
fifty two of list i does not have the effect of transferring or transplanting as
it may be called, of the industries engaged in production and manufacture of intoxicating liquors
from the state list to union list. as a matter of fact, parliament cannot take
over the control of industries engaged in the production and manufacture of intoxicating liquors by
making a declaration under entry fifty two of list i. since the state entry governs
only entry twenty four list ii, but not entry eight list ii. faced with the
above position learned counsel for the petitioners resorted to more than one argument to get
over it.
firstly, it was submitted that the entries twenty four and eight should be read harmoniously
and that such harmonious reading should mean that the industries engaged in production and manufacture
of intoxicating liquors would fall within entry twenty four because entry twenty four deals with
industries as such, while entry eight, according to such reading, would be confined to matters
other than production and manufacture of intoxicating liquors.
it is not possible to agree with the submission which runs counter to the express
language of entry eight.
it requires us to delete the words 'production and manufacture from entry eight which is
not open to us.
we cannot re write the entry.
another limb of this argument was that only those industries manufacturing intoxicating liquors which are
not within the purview of the idr. act will fall under entry eight.
now kindly see (d).
reading the definition of industrial undertaking in clause (d) and the definition of factory in
clause (c) of section three of the idr. acts it is submitted that two types
of industries are not covered by the idr act viz.
those where manufacturing process is carried on (i) with the aid of power but with
less than fifty workers and (ii) without the aid of power but with less than
one hundred workers.
the submission is that these industries which are not within the purview of the idr.
act would remain within the purview of entry eight while the other industries would be
under the control of the union. this argument is equally unacceptable.
this argument is premised upon the assumption that entry fifty two in list i over-rides
entry eight in list ii as well, which assumption, as we shall presently point outs
is without a basis and unacceptable, moreover, industries which are exempted from the idr. act
are exempted because of the very provisions of the idr act- and not by virtue
of entry eight in list-ii. the ambit and scope of a constitutional entry cannot be
determined with reference to a parliamentary enactment.
the definition of factory in clause (c) of section three of the idr act may
be changed tomorrow.
the meaning and scope of entry eight in list ii does not and cannot vary
with the change in the provisions of the idr act. this submission too is, therefore,
unacceptable.
it was then contended that entry fifty two in list i governs not only entry
twenty four in list ii but all other entries in list ii including entry eight
insofar as it deals with industries.
we cannot accept this submission either.
a perusal of list ii would show that whenever a particular entry was intended to
be made subject to an entry in list i or list iii, it has been
so stated specifically.
not one but several entries in list ii are made subject to one or the
other entry in list i or list iii. see entries two, three, seventeen, twenty two,
twenty three, twenty six, twenty seven and thirty three.
certain other entries use a different phraseology to demarcate the spheres of the union and
the states. for example, entry thirty two, incorporation, regulation and winding up of corporations other
than those.
likewise, my lord, entry fifty one, list ii. all this shows that whenever a particular
entry in list ii is sought to be made subject to another entry in list
i or list ii or where a demarcation is sought to be made between the
union and the states within a particular head of legislation, the founding fathers have taken
care to say so expressly.
we cannot, therefore, accept the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners that entry
fifty two in list i impinges upon, over- rides and governs entry eight in list
ii as well.
it does not.
we must make it clear that entry eight speaks of only intoxicating liquors and does
not, therefore, apply to or take in liquors which do not fall within the expression
intoxicating liquors.
the power to make a law with respect to production and manufacture of intoxicating liquors
is that of the states alone.
the prohibition of production and manufacture of intoxicating liquors too squarely falls within the four
corners of entry eight read with entry six of list ii'.
this was the decision of the constitution bench in khoday distilleries. article forty seven, then
they refer to.
then, your lordship, they referred to.
thirty seven straight away. thirty seven.
yes, my lord. that will cover calcutta gas company. my lord, i am grateful.
again we may in this connection.
and this is the first case where this principle was evolved.
correct. we may in this connection refer to constitution based decision of this court in
calcutta gas versus state of west bengal, which furnishes a complete answer to the petitioner's
contention on this court. the west bengal legislature passed an act, west bengal oriental gas
company act, nineteen sixty, with a view to take over their management and control of
the undertaking of the oriental gas company. notifications were issued under the act taking over
the company, which was questioned by way of a writ petition in calcutta high court.
the writ petition was dismissed, whereupon the matter was brought to this court. the main
contention on behalf of the appellant was that the west bengal legislature has no legislative
competence to enact the said act. it was submitted that by virtue of industries development
regulation act nineteen fifty one, which contains a declaration in terms of entry fifty two
in list i and the schedule thereof included fuel gas, coal gas, natural gas and
the like under item two, three.
the power to make law with respect to those industries engaged in the manufacturer of
gas has been vested in the union, and that state has been totally denuded of
that power.
it was contended that entry twenty four in list ii takes in all industries in
that entry twenty five, which reads gas and gas works, should be confined to matters
other than those covered by entry twenty four.
inasmuch as the impugned enactment was a law relating to gas industry, it was submitted,
the act made by the state legislature is incompetent and void.
reliance was also placed upon article two hundred and forty six of the constitution. all
these contentions were negatived.
after referring to the provisions of the idr act and the impugned west bengal act,
the relevant entries in the seventh schedule to the constitution, including entries seven and fifty
two in list i and entries twenty four to twenty seven in list ii, and
the principles governing the interpretation of the entries in the seventh schedule, the court indicated
that the matter was susceptible of three possible constructions: (one) entry twenty four of list
ii, which provides for industries, generally, covers the industrial aspect of gas and gas works
leaving entry twenty five to provide for other aspects of gas and gas works; (two)
entry twenty four provides generally for industries, and entry twenty five carves out of it
the specific industry of gas and gas works, with the result that the industry of
gas and gas works, is excluded from entry twenty four; and (three) the industry of
gas and gas-works falls under both the entries, that is, there is a real overlapping
of the said entries.
the court opined that having regard to the well-settled principles relating to interpretation of these
entries, that interpretation which reconciles and harmonises the contending entries should be adopted and held.
and entry twenty four in list ii in its widest amplitude takes in all industries,
including that of gas and gas works.
so too, entry twenty five of the said list comprehends gas industry.
there is therefore an apparent conflict between the two entries, and they overlap each other.
in such a contingency, the doctrine of harmonious construction must be invoked.
if industry in entry twenty four is interpreted to include gas and gas works, entry
the twenty fifth of may become redundant.
and in the context of succeeding increase, namely entry twenty six dealing with trade and
commerce and entry twenty seven dealing with production, supply and distribution of goods, it will
be deprived of all its content and reduce to useless lumber.
on the other hand, the alternative contention enables entries twenty four and twenty five to
operate fully in their respective fields.
while entry twenty four covers a wide field that is the field of the entire
industry in the state, entry twenty five dealing with gas and gas works can be
confined to a specific entry that is the gas industry.
it is therefore clear, that the scheme of the harmonious construction suggested on behalf of
the state gives full and effective scope of operation for both the entries in their
respective fields.
while that suggested by the learned counsel for the appellant deprives entry twenty five of
all its content and makes it redundant.
the former interpretation must therefore be accepted in preference to the latter.
in this view, gas and gas works are within the exclusive field allotted to the
state. on this interpretation the argument of the learned attorney general that under two forty
six of the constitution, the legislative power of state is subject to that of parliament
ceases to have any force, for the gas industry is outside the legislative field of
parliament and is within the exclusive field of the legislature of the state. we, therefore,
hold that the impugned act was within the legislative competence of the bengal legislature and
was, therefore, validly made.
the court proceeded to hold further.
your lordships, it's a repetition, the rest, my lord. the ratio of the above decision
fully supports what we have said hereinbefore.
in fact, entry eight is more specific than entry twenty five in list ii. while
entry twenty five merely speaks of gas and gas-works, entry eight expressly speaks of production
and manufacture besides possession, transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors.
the ratio of the calcutta gas case fully supports our conclusion that the industries engaged
in the production and manufacture of intoxicating liquors are outside the purview of entry twenty
four and fall squarely within entry eight in list ii, and that entry fifty two
in list i does not override or impinge upon entry eight in list ii. according
to this decision, the expression industry in both entry twenty four and entry fifty two
in list i must carry the same meaning, which means that if a particular industry
is not within the purview of entry twenty four in list ii, it would not
equally be within the purview of entry fifty two, list i. the decision also supports
our conclusion.
article two hundred and forty six cannot be invoked to deprive the state legislature of
the powers inhering in them by virtue of entries in list ii. once enactment in
pith and substance is relatable to entry eight in list ii or for that matter
any other entry in list ii, article two forty six cannot be brought in to
yet hold that state legislature is not competent.
now, what is important here again is that all these decisions are based on what
we call the word industry.
my lord, one word industry in entry twenty four as the judgment says has the
same meaning as in entry fifty two.
but what is the scope of this word industry and that is where tika ramji
is the locus classicus.
yes. which is (nineteen fifty six) scr three hundred and ninety three pdf page eighty
and this tika ramji's case still holds the field.
mister dwivedi we discussed calcutta gas company, right?
that is volume v. page pdf twenty one forty nine.
just come to that judgment para nine, where tika ramji is elaborately discussed.
yes that will give a fair idea.
your lordships are right, my lord. tika ramji was considered by calcutta gas and that
is for the word industry.
para nine at pdf twenty one fifty eight.
i'm grateful about fifteen lines.
.
twenty one fifty eight correct in the para nine.
in a descending order.
first question that occurs, if i may please, with your lordship's permission?
yes. the first question that occurs.
give us the, which page you are reading?
twenty one fifty eight pdf page, volume five and we are at twenty one fifty.
pdf page twenty one fifty eight.
that's the whole confusion.
the first question.
if i may place?
yes. the first question that occurs to one's mind is what is the meaning of
the expression industry in entry twenty four of list ii?
is it different from the meaning of that expression in entry fifty two list ii?
whatever maybe it's connotation, it must bear the same meaning in both the entries for
the two entries are so interconnected that conflicting or different meanings given to them would
snap the connection.
entry twenty four is subject to the provisions of entry seven and fifty two list
i. entry seven of list i provides for industries declared by parliament, by law to
be necessary for the purposes of defence or for the prosecution of war and entry
fifty two for industries the control of which by the union is declared by parliament,
by law, to be expedient in the public interest.
therefore, ordinarily, industry is in the field of state legislation.
but if parliament by law makes a relevant declaration or declarations, the industry or industries
so declared would be taken off its field and passed on to parliament. in the
premises the expression industry in all the entries must be given the same meaning.
now, what is the meaning of the word industry?
in tika ramji state of up, the expression industry is defined to mean 'the process
of manufacture or production' and does not include the raw materials used in the industry
or the distribution of the products of the industry.
it was contented that the word industry was a word of wide import and should
be construed as including not only the process of manufacture or production, but also activities
and antecedent thereto such as acquisition of raw materials and subsequent thereto such as disposal
of the finished products of that industry.
but that contention was not accepted.
it is not necessary in this case to attempt to define the expression industry precisely
or to state exhaustively all its ingredients.
assuming that the expression means only production or manufacture, would it take in its sweep
production or manufacture, of gas?
entry twenty four in list ii in its widest amplitude takes in all industries, including
that of gas and gas-works.
so too, entry twenty five of the said list comprehends gas industry.
there is therefore, an apparent conflict between the two entries and they overlap each other.
in such a contingency doctrine of harmonious construction must be invoked.
both the learned counsels accept the principle, while the learned attorney general seeks to harmonise
both the entries by giving the widest meaning to the word industry.
so as to include the industrial aspect of gas and gas works and leaving the
other aspects to be covered by.
my lord, the rest my lord is covered under mcdowell, your lordships have already seen
that.
but the critical part in my lord, tika ramji's consideration is not entirely here and
therefore, what i want to do is not to cut short time instead of reading
all those decisions, there are at least five - seven constitution benches in that sphere,
so it will be wasting time.
there's one judgment of your lordships which deals with all of them, my lord and
synopsizes all those cases right from tika ramji onwards till itc judgement.
and this is still holding the field there's no dispute with regard to this.
were you referring to this?
i was reading the original tika ramji 'industry in the wide sense of the term
would be capable of comprising three different aspects'.
were you reading that part?
i'm on tika ramji. my, lord that was very well dealt with in tika ramji,
my lord all the matters, all the aspects of industry they noted.
you see paragraph twenty four at volume v, page ninety six, volume v tika ramji
begins at page eighty yes, and if you see paragraph twenty four.
actually, that's a crucial part of tika ramji. see there, the question was whether the
process of acquiring sugar cane, which was a raw material for the manufacture of sugar,
whether that will be covered within the ambit of industry.
that they said would fall as 'goods' under entry twenty six.
para twenty four is important, actually, at page ninety six, pdf page ninety six.
yes. the passage begins as, it is clear, therefore.
have your lordships got it?
yes. it is clear, therefore, that all acts, all the acts and the notifications issued
thereunder by the centre, in regard to sugar and sugar cane, were enacted in excise
of the concurrent jurisdiction.
the exercise of such concurrent jurisdiction would not deprive the provincial legislature of similar powers
which they had under the provincial legislative list, and there would therefore be no question
of legislative competence.
incompetence. i'm sorry.
incompetence qua the provincial legislature in regard to similar pieces of legislation enacted by the
latter.
the provincial legislature as well as the central legislature would be competent to enact such
pieces of legislation and no question of legislative competence would arise.
it also follows as a necessary corollary that even though sugar industry was a controlled
industry, none of these acts enacted by the centre was in exercise of its jurisdiction
under entry fifty two, list i. now, actually what follows is very important.
industry in the wide sense.
in the wide sense.
industry, in the wide sense of the term, would be capable of comprising three different
aspects.
one) raw materials which are an integral part of the industrial process.
two) the process of manufacture or production; and three) the distribution of the products of
the industry.
the raw material would be goods, which would be comprised in entry twenty seven of
list ii. the process of manufacture or production would be comprised in entry twenty four
of list ii, except where the industry was a controlled industry when it would fall
under entry fifty two, list i. and the products of the industry would also be
comprised in entry twenty seven of list ii as 'goods', except where they were the
products of the controlled industry when they would fall under entry thirty three, list iii.
this being the position, it cannot be said that the legislation which was enacted by
the centre in regard to sugar, and sugar cane would fall within entry fifty two
of list i. before sugar industry became a controlled industry, both sugar and sugar cane
fell within entry twenty seven of list ii. but after declaration was made by parliament
in nineteen fifty one by act sixty five of ' fifty one, sugar industry became
a controlled industry and the product of that industry which is sugar, was comprised in
entry thirty three of list iii, taking it out the entry twenty seven of list
ii. even so, the centre as well as the state legislatures had concurrent jurisdiction in
regard to the same.
in no event could the legislation in regard to the sugar and sugar cane, be
thus be included in the entry fifty two of list i. the pith and substance
argument also cannot be imported here for the simple reason that when both the centre
as well as the state legislatures were operating in the concurrent field, there was no
question of any trespass on the exclusive jurisdiction vested in the centre under entry fifty
two of list i. the only question that survived being whether putting both the pieces
of legislation enacted and the state legislature together, there was any repugnancy in issue, and
here they found, my lord, there was no repugnancy because there was no central law.
the 'conflict has to be in fact', my lord, this is the judgment which for
the first time said there has to be a 'conflict in fact', and therefore you've
got to legislate under the idr act to control this.
but then the interesting part of it is my lord, this which your lordships will
bear in mind.
kindly come to entry thirty three.
there is one interesting factor which your lordships may take into consideration here again which.
difference in tika ramji was, tika ramji was concerned with the control over the antecedent
raw material.
over here we are not dealing with the control over the antecedent raw material.
this is the heart of the industry.
but the word 'industry' was considered and the scope of word industry was found.
no, but important part is, 'why'.
question was that was tika ramji is a case where on the one hand there
was.
actually but for entry eight of list ii, industrial alcohol would fall within the ambit
of industry in entry fifty two of list i. how would it fall, my lord?
this is a question i. but for entry eight.
it's an industry.
i'll answer that, my lord. then we would at the same time be saying that
intoxicating liquor would be only potable liquor and industry pertaining to portable liquor would exclusively
go to entry eight.
no, that's not.
i'm saying that it is because of entry eight that it doesn't go into entry
twenty four and doesn't go into entry fifty two, but if entry eight was not
there.
then it could have been.
it would have been an industry then, within entry fifty two of list one.
yes, no doubt about it.
important thing is tika ramji. so, what is the ambit of the expression?
i'll answer that.
fermentation and.
your lordship has?
my lord kindly again go back to.
there are two answers to what your lordship's query is.
what would be the difference between intoxicating liquor and alcohol?
every intoxicating liquor, as per the local act your lordship has seen meant all liquids
containing alcohol.
so, every alcohol will have to be there.
because under the entry twenty six of the schedule. that is the changed entry my
lord. one is.
it's a modified entry.
this has been modified in twenty sixteen where, because of the bihar distillery they carved
out an exception against potable alcohol which was not there earlier.
when these cases were considered mcdowell, tika ramji the position was entirely different.
only fermentation in the industry was specified with alcohol, the word 'alcohol'.
what is the entry before twenty sixteen?
the only thing within the brackets were omitted.
it was fermented one into the products.
alcohol and other products of.
fermentation. yes. so other than potable alcohol was added by the twenty sixteen.
that bracket portion was added.
so, fermentation industries would take an intoxicating liquor?
normally, my lords, fermentation industry that was interpretation given to it.
but the whole question is, can you take it?
that's the question.
can the parliament take it?
now to answer, the chief justice's query.
no one has challenged, there's no doubt about it.
no one has challenged, the inclusion of fermentation industry.
there's no doubt about it.
but in calcutta gas no one had challenged it, yet the court struck down that
on the ground that we are deciding and deciphering the scope of legislative entry.
so if the act of another two legislatures do not fall within that entry, then
they have to go.
the dominant legislature has to prevail likewise in itc, again, the same thing was done.
this objection was raised, that no one has challenged the idr act. but the whole
question would be, that if the parliament legislates.
if we accept your submission.
i mean, not that we are saying that it's wrong we're just trying to explore
it.
that would mean that any industry that is specified in list ii that would include
gas work that would include intoxicating liquor, that will fall outside entry fifty two of
list i. fifty two of list i. fifty four is mines and minerals. your lordships
has done the mines and minerals matter with entry fifty four.occurs in. fifty two.
it would be outside that.
no, but then why does parliament cover.
prior to twenty sixteen, parliament covers the entirety of alcohol.
but the whole issue is whether that is correct or not?
because your lordships are defining the scope of the entry and parliament is legislating on
an entry which is not there in their field.
so, how can.
my lord legislation without power is a void legislation, still born.
but you are appearing for whom?
the state of up up my lord we are the petitioners actually sitting on the
wrong side, actually.
that is the problem.
but are you saying, therefore, that the legislation which is enacted by parliament is void?
yes. otherwise we can't get the jurisdiction, my lord. kindly look at it this way.
state's jurisdiction has been denied by synthetics on these grounds, entry fifty two.
now, if we do not challenge that, synthetics cannot be overcome.
if synthetics overcome, then what are we, with due respects reconsidering?
we are considering whether synthetics when it relies upon entry fifty two to shut down
state's jurisdiction in respect of intoxicating liquor, which includes industrial alcohol that is incorrect, and
state's jurisdiction cannot be taken away.
synthetics took away because of entry fifty two and idr. my lord, i'll satisfy your
lordships on this issue that i need not challenge if the question arises during consideration.
what is the scope of the legislative entry and if there is any conflict, your
lordships will have to resolve the conflict.
and if, your lordships resolve the conflict in the manner i am advocating, my lords,
then the question would be clear that centre had legislated absolutely illegally.
otherwise, your lordships would see even though state has jurisdiction under entry eight yet because
of parliamentary declaration or legislation, we are denied the power to legislate on our own
field.
my lord, whatever is troubling your lordship that no one has challenged idr, my lord,
was answered by itc. legislated. exactly. on an industry which falls within the scope of
entry eight of list ii. exactly. because alcohol.
my lord, that is, assuming it falls.
my lord, industrial alcohol, if it is part of intoxicating, then what your lordship is
saying is correct.
but if it has, then what will be the consequence.
and the aspect that is troubling your lordships here is that since no one has
challenged idr and it has been prevailing, then what can be done?
my lord that is answered by itc. we need not challenge it.
when lordships determine the scope of the entries, then the power of the state with
respect to its own entry cannot be declined because parliament has declared something.
otherwise, tomorrow parliament will take over gas and gas works, then what happens?
see because article two hundred and forty six (one), it begins with a non obstante
clause.
notwithstanding anything contained in clauses two and three.
clauses two is with regard to concurrent list. clause three is with regard to state
list. notwithstanding anything contained in the concurrent list and the state list, parliament has exclusive
power to do it with regard to union list. now, let me explain it this
way.
your lordships saw in that case of, my lord, jayant verma, the word 'notwithstanding' is
a concept which only emerges when there is an irreconcilable conflict.
first, the effort should be to reconcile the conflict if it appears now, parliament may
have legislative on 'a' entry or 'b' entry, but the fact is what we have
to see is whether that legislation is within its field or not and likewise state
legislation within its field or not.
now, when we find that there are two entries which are overlapping, for instance, industry,
gas and gas works, they were overlapping, the court found in mcdowell as well as
calcutta gas. now, if they were overlapping, then your lordships have to evolve some principles
of harmonious construction.
my lord, the non-obstante clause.
the other harmonious way would be to say that, 'yes, the state does have the
power over intoxicating liquor but once there is a declaration made by parliament under entry
fifty two, then your power is denuded'.
which means entry eight list ii, even though it is not being made specifically subject
to entry fifty two, it becomes subject to like entry twenty four.
so, what are we saying is that we are reading word 'subject to' in entry
eight which perhaps it is not open to read.
then what is the meaning to be given to the expression 'notwithstanding anything contained' in
article two hundred and forty six (one)?
i'll answer that.
'notwithstanding' means in case the conflict is irreconcilable, harmoniously, then, in that event, parliamentary entry
would prevail over the state entry.
but the fact is, when your lordships can reconcile harmoniously, as your lordships have done
in the case of mcdowell and calcutta gas, then perhaps non obstante clause would not
operate.
that is the question.
no, but in every case.
whether we can narrow the scope of the expression 'industry' in entry fifty two, list
i. entry twenty four, list i. entry fifty two, list i. for that the answer
was there in this mcdowell’s case.
entry fifty two draws from entry twenty four.
now what we have to see, what is the position in the state list with
regard to word 'industry' in the state list. now in the state list, 'industry' means
what?
that has been determined in calcutta gas as well as mcdowell. it means only manufacture,
it would not include entry twenty six, twenty seven or any other entry that is
not subject to it.
for instance, calcutta gas entry twenty five, that is also an industry, like entry eight.
now calcutta gas union took over the jurisdiction by specifying it as an idea.
under the idea in the schedule. now, despite the fact they had specified in the
idea the gas and gas works.
yet, the court said, when we look into the entries that are there, what appears
to be is that the word 'industry' in state list would exclude those entries which
are independent of and are not subject to entry fifty two.
for instance, gas and gas works is not subject to, but if parliament can still
take it over, then what is the point in specifying twenty five, list ii separately.
it could have been there in the word 'industry'.
so long it has not taken over by the parliamentary law, it will remain with
the state list, but once it comes under the idr act, what happens?
i think there's one thing which has been missed, my lord. i would submit with
due respect.
so long it is not taken over, but what can be taken over is only
what is there in industry, that is, entry twenty four.
it cannot take over something which is not there in entry twenty four.
now our submission is with the support of mcdowell and the other cases, that entry
twenty four will not include entry eight.
that is what mcdowell says, and it will not include entry twenty five that is
what calcutta gas says.
if word 'industry' does not include that, then you can't take it over.
parliament cannot take it over.
power of parliament is not entirely absolutely wide and expansive.
parliament's power cannot run amok over the state list, except so far as word 'industry'
in entry twenty four is concerned.
so, it is twenty four only, which is subject to deprivation on a declaration.
no other entry.
what else now remains?
i really wanted to read this judgement which is, itc (two thousand two), nine scc
two hundred and thirty two.
this is volume v, pdf page fifteen ninety seven.
this would clarify all the queries that have fallen from your lordships and therefore i
wanted to.
if i may indicate the paragraphs, para ten.
i'll give the paragraphs which are relevant for my purpose, para.
ten, twenty six to thirty two, forty, eighty six and this deals with the entire
history with regard to the word 'industry'.
entry fifty two as well as entry twenty four.
this is in volume five, fifteen ninety seven?
yes. so instead of reading all these decisions, my lord this has the judgments, all
the judgments, constitution bench judgment in the synopsized form.
to give the gist of the dispute my lord, kindly come to pdf page sixteen
seventeen.
now, in this case, the minority judgment holds the, my lord, in favour of the
union that the incidental encroachment would take away the power of the state. in the
proposed judgment.
this is the minority judgment and justice sabharwal's judgment is the majority judgment.
in the proposed judgment, justice pattanaik has held that the word industry in entry. just
tell us the para once again.
para ten, pdf page sixteen seventeen.
we are now referring to, justice sabharwal's judgement, right?
justice sabharwal's judgement.
chief justice sabharwal's in fact.
yes no, i'm sorry.
he was not the chief justice at that time.
justice bharucha was the chief justice. in the proposed judgment, justice pattanaik has held that
the word 'industry' in entry fifty two of union. and by the way this will
answer the other question too completely.
this will answer the other question too.
therefore, i chose this decision that will save time.
in the proposed judgment, justice pattanaik has held the word 'industry' in entry fifty two
of the union list cannot be given restricted meaning so as to exclude from its
purview the subject of legislation coming within entry twenty seven or entry fourteen of list
ii and thus, the parliamentary legislation, namely, the tobacco board act, nineteen seventy five is
constitutionally valid and consequently, the state legislations entitling the market committee to levy fee for
sale and purchase of raw tobacco within the market area will not be operative so
far as the produce of tobacco is concerned and that the majority judgment in the
itc case is correctly decided.
your lordship may omit the rest.
kindly come to paragraph twenty six.
it is pdf page sixteen twenty one.
before considering the aforenoted decisions, it would be appropriate to make it clear that in
these matters it has to be kept in view that this court is not examining
a case where the field of legislation is in concurrent list to which article two
forty six (two) applies.
this court is also not considering the case of an incidental trenching of field by
one or the other legislature.
the court is concerned with the question of legislative competence.
we are examining a case where what has been questioned is the legality of the
legislation in respect of a field in the state list to which article two forty
six (three) applies.
the validity and applicability of the state legislations in respect of a field of legislation
of state list has come under a cloud on account of a legislation passed by
the parliament in respect of field of legislation under entry fifty two of the union
list, namely, the tobacco board act, nineteen seventy five.
it is on account of this legislation containing declaration as contemplated by entry fifty two
of the union list that doubts have arisen about the validity and applicability of state
legislation about the sale of agricultural produce of tobacco in market areas and levy thereupon
of market fee which aspect are on field of legislation on the state list, entries
fourteen, twenty seven, twenty eight and sixty six.
entry twenty four of the state list is subject to entries seven and fifty two
of list i. we are not concerned in these matter with entry seven.
the question here is as to the effect of transfer of field of legislation under
entry twenty four of the state list to the union list, entry fifty two, on
other fields in the state list, namely, fields of legislation under entries fourteen, twenty seven,
twenty eight and sixty six and what is fact can be transferred.
that's the question we are concerned with in this case.
now they refer to baijnath kadio, your lordship may omit that.
twenty eight also your lordships may omit that.
kindly come to thirty one.
thirty, my lord. relying upon ishwari khetan's case mister shanti bhushan contends that entry fifty
two has been equated with entry fifty four of the union list. both sides have
relied upon the case of ishwari khetan.
let us examine that case.
in ishwari khetan's case the contention urged was that the parliament has made the industrial
(development and regulation) act, nineteen fifty one (for short, 'the idr act') in entry fifty
two list i declaring control of sugar industry and that industry goes out of entry
twenty four of list ii and, therefore, state legislature is denuded of legislative powers in
respect of sugar industry and impugned legislation was with respect to acquisition of sugar undertaking
and sugar industry.
the attorney general and contended that the power to acquire property was derived from entry
forty two of list iii. ishwari khetan's case involved the determination or scope of entry
fifty two of list i and entry twenty four of list ii only.
the scope of these entries with respect to entries twenty six and twenty seven of
list ii and entry thirty three of list iii did not fall for consideration.
paragraphs seven, eight and eleven of ishwari khetan the constitution bench repeatedly pointed out that
a declaration in entry fifty two of list i denudes state legislature of the power
to legislate under entry twenty four, list ii only.
kindly notice this, 'only'.
it was noticed that the sugar was a declared industry.
the question posed was that is it, however, correct to say that once a declaration
is made as envisaged by entry fifty two list i, that industry as a whole
is taken out of entry twenty four of list ii?
the answer given by the constitutional bench was that it is not correct to say
that once a declaration is made in respect of an industry that industry as a
whole is taken out of entry twenty four list ii. it was said that the
industry as a legislative head is found itself placed in entry twenty four of list
ii. the state legislature can be denied legislative power under entry twenty four to the
extent parliament makes declaration under entry fifty two and by such declaration, parliament acquired power
to legislate only in respect of those industries in respect of which declaration is made
and to that extent as manifested by legislation incorporating the declaration and not more.
your lordships may recall, my lord, that initially your lordships had posed this question that
entry fifty two does not use the word 'to the extent'.
the bench further said that the legislative power of the state under entry twenty four,
list ii is eroded only to the extent the control is assumed by the union
pursuant to the declaration and the state legislature which is otherwise competent to deal with
industry under entry twenty four, list ii can deal with that industry in exercise of
other powers enabling it to legislate under different heads set out in list ii and
list iii and this power cannot be denied to the state. the extent of parliamentary
legislation was seen only to determine how much is taken out from entry twenty four
list ii and not for the purposes of laying down any principle that parliamentary legislation
has to be seen to determine the extent of control and the denudation of the
power of the state legislature to the extent the control is laid down by the
parliament. further, it was held that despite the parliamentary legislation the state legislature can deal
with industry in exercise of other powers in different entries in list ii and list
iii and that power cannot be denied to the state. in this case the court
was examining whether the law of acquisition of sugar undertaking was referable to entry twenty
four, list ii or entry forty two, list iii. it was concluded that the acquisition
of the property was referable to entry forty two list iii. the scope of the
industry did not fall for examination in ishwari khetan's case.
there is no discussion on the interpretation of expression 'industry' and that probably is the
reason why tika ramji's case has not been referred to.
the reliance on baijnath kadio's case in ishwari khetan's case was to show the denudation
of states' power being limited to the extent of control.
while baijnath kadio's case dealt with entry twenty three, list ii, ishwari khetan's case dealt
with entry twenty four, list ii. the subject matter of the other entries was not
in issue in this decision.
the structure in entry fifty four of list i was not equated with that of
entry fifty two list i as contended by mister shanti bhushan. this decision does not
adopt the mines and minerals cases for the purposes of considering the scope of entry
fifty two of list i. in our view, the cases of mines and minerals are
not of much assistance while examining the scope of entry fifty two of list i.
in state of ap versus mcdowell also it was held that the ambit and scope
of a constitutional entry cannot be determined with reference to a parliamentary enactment.
if it is otherwise, it would result in the parliament enacting and/or amending an enactment
thereby controlling the ambit and scope of the constitutional provision.
that cannot be the law.
the power to legislate with which we are concerned in contained in article two hundred
and forty six.
the fields are demarcated in the various entries.
on reading both, it has to be decided whether the concerned legislature is competent to
legislate when its validity is questioned.
the ambit and scope of an entry cannot be determined with reference to a parliamentary
enactment.
tika ramji's case is required to be examined in detail, since that has been the
bone of serious elaborate submissions in that case.
the challenge by the sugarcane growers hailing from several villages of the state of up
was to the validity of up sugarcane, (regulation of supply and purchase) act ' fifty
three and notification issued thereunder.
a short history of legislation enacted by the centre as well as the province of
up in regard to sugar and sugarcane was noticed.
your lordships may omit that.
kindly come to para forty, pdf page sixteen twenty six.
on the thirty first of october nineteen fifty one, parliament enacted the industries development regulation
act ' fifty one to provide for the development and regulation of certain industries.
by section two of the act, it was declared that it was expedient in the
public interest that the union should take in its control, the industries specified in first
schedule. the schedule included industries engaged in the manufacture or production of sugar.
the up legislature enacted impugned act. the object of it was as follows: with the
promulgation of industries development regulation act, with effect from so and so, the regulation of
sugar industry has been exclusively a central subject.
the state government are now only concerned with the supply of sugarcane to the sugar
factories.
the bill is being introduced in order to provide for rational distribution of sugarcane to
factories for its development on organized scientific lines to protect the interest of the cane
growers of the industry and to put the new act permanently on the statute.
in exercise of the rulemaking power conferred by the impugned act, the up government made
rules and also promulgated up sugarcane regulation supply purchase order. all these related to the
supplies and purchase of sugarcane in up. challenging the vires of the state act, one
of the submissions made in tika ramji's case before the constitution. we have seen tika
ramji. why are we reading this?
actually, if you go to para sixty one, that's where justice sabharwal has summed up
what he wants to say.
just see para sixty one at sixteen thirty two.
kindly give me one minute, my lord. that will be your internal page two hundred
and sixty seven of the judgment.
sabharwal says this is.
just see placitum c at page sixteen thirty two.
placitum c, if you have the same copy.
sixteen thirty two placitum c. the expression industries in entry twenty four of list ii
or entry fifty two of list i cannot be interpreted in a manner that would
make other entries of list ii of the seventh schedule subject to union control which
in fact they are not.
whether it was intended to be made subject to such control, whether of list i
or that of list iii, it was said so.
a perusal of list ii shows that whenever a particular entry was intended to be
made subject to an entry in list i or iii which has been so stated
specifically.
therefore, an interpretation which tends to have the effect of making a particular entry subject
to any other entry, though not so stated in the entry, deserves to be avoided
unless that be the only possible interpretation.
we do not think that certain interpretations on the entries in question, namely fifty two
of the union list and twenty four of the state list deserves to be placed.
that is really the heart of what the learned judge said.
quite right.
but one of the passages your lordships have dealt with this issue also.
this is not a dissent is it?
this is not a dissent.
this is the majority judgement.
now they had dealt with this issue that central act has not challenged idr. they
have dealt with that.
they have dealt with that as well.
the learned judge says if and when it is challenged.
no, it's come expressly.
i will show.
paragraph sixty four at page sixteen thirty three.
shadan, just give it to him.
para sixty four at sixteen thirty three.
the validity of certain other acts, such as cardamom act, central silk board act, coffee
act so on and so forth.
reference where of was made by mister shanti bhushan need not be examined for the
purpose of considering the legislative competence.
i will place it if your lordships permits me.
the legislative competence of parliament to legislate these statutes is not in issue before this
court and, therefore, we do not think it necessary to examine the question of legislative
competence only from academic view point insofar as these legislations are concerned.
however, prima facie, there is no substance in the apprehension expressed by mister shanti bhushan
that narrow approach of the concept of 'industry'.
no, not this one my lord. just see following sentence.
as and when these acts are challenged.
i'll answer that because in this case, this question was raised because no one has
challenged the central act. therefore. i'll just.
kindly give me just a minute.
just two sentences after that.
what the chief justice was trying to say.
i will cull it out and give it to your lordships. actually, tika ramji dealt
with a process anterior to manufacture, namely acquisition of the raw material which is sugarcane.
they said that the acquisition of the raw material would not be comprehended within the
expression of the word 'industry' under entry fifty two.
my lord, even the end product right. in our case, entry eight covers not just
intoxicating liquors, but it covers.
production and manufacturing.
production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase, and even sale of intoxicating liquor.
everything. so, really speaking, entry eight would cover the entire gamut of entry fifty two
as well.
that's what mcdowell says.
that's why a specific entry having been made by the founders or the framers of
the constitution, the entry eight must govern.
kindly have, my lord, para forty five.
kindly have para forty five.
para forty five your lordship would find.
and in this case, they struck down the idr specification even though.
kindly have para forty five.
true, the challenge was to the vires of the state legislation that is page.
yes. and not to the parliamentary legislation. but at the same time, the entire basis
of challenge was that in respect of sugarcane, only parliament had the power to legislate
on account of field being covered under entry fifty two, list i. the sugar industry
having been included in the entry and the connotation of industry being verified to include
in it raw materials and sugarcane as well.
thus, the exclusive power of parliament to legislate was urged as the main ground to
seek invalidation of the state legislation. the field of sugarcane is not available to the
state legislature to legislate.
that's what was argued.
and forty six were in view of the controversy as aforesaid, the fact that the
validity of the parliamentary legislation was not an issue n the tika ramji case, does
not in any manner affect the ratio of that division.
the point for determination in that case was substantially the same as in the present
case, namely, the scope of the expression 'industry' in entry fifty two list i and
entry twenty four list ii. there also the point was to adopt a narrow or
a wide interpretation of the expression industry.
further, the fact that it was a case of manufacturing industry under idr act also
does not affect the ratio of the case.
the interpretation placed in tika ramji cannot be confined to industry, falling under idr act
alone.
there is neither any express or implied indication in that decision to limit the scope.
then kindly have fifty, my lord, which is important at page two hundred and sixty.
fifty, my lord. the petitioners in tika ramji's case in support of the wide construction
to be placed upon the expression 'industry' also relied upon various decisions interpreting the said
term in relation to industrial disputes act. what we are concerned here is not the
wide construction to be put on the term industry as such, but whether the raw
material of an industry which forms an integral part of the process are within the
topic of industry, which form the subject matter of item fifty two, list i as
ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly or reasonably be said to be comprehended in
that topic and whether the central legislation while legislating upon sugar industry could, acting within
the sphere of entry fifty two of list i as well, legislate upon sugarcane.
this court said that if the legislation with regard to sugarcane came within the exclusive
province of the central legislature under entry fifty two of list i, the enactment passed
by the provincial legislature would be ultra vires.
your lordships, kindly come to the next point.
your lordships have already seen the gist of all these cases.
kindly come to para fifty seven.
para fifty seven, sixteen thirty mister shanti bhushan, however, contends that once the field is
covered by entry fifty two, by issue of requisite declaration and parliament has actually covered
the field by enacting a legislation with regard to that extent, the industry, including all
facets of such an industry, whether it is raw material or the products of that
industry the state legislature will have no power to legislate.
the contention is that the expression 'industries' in entry fifty two list i, comprises in
it all its aspects, commencing from procurement of raw material and up to the disposal
of final product of that industry, not only the process of manufacture or production.
the submission of learned counsel is that the expression 'industries' in the entries under consideration
is not given such interpretation, it would denude the parliament of the real objective control
and such industry in particular in public interest, which is of paramount importance.
as against this, the contention of the other side is that the acceptance of a
viewpoint propounded by shri shanti bhushan would mean denuding the state legislature of the power
to legislate in respect.
my lord. views of mister bhushan were negative.
negative. now come straight to para seventy eight.
why do they say so?
come to seventy eight.
reliance was also placed.
acceptance of the argument of mister shanti bhushan. the acceptance of the argument.
i'm just.
acceptance of the argument of mister shanti bhushan would make various entries in the state
list otiose and meaningless and subject to entry fifty two of list i, despite the
fact that the entries are not so.
now come to para eighty two.
where he also relied on entry fifty four of the union list and entry twenty
three of the state list. and what is the ultimate finding?
the structure and scope of entry fifty four of the union list and entry twenty
three of the state list and their inter-relationship is substantially different from the scope and
structure of entry twenty four of the state list and entry fifty two of the
union list. the entry relating to development of mines and minerals has in it both
the industry of mines and the product of minerals.
and therefore on a declaration both mines and minerals get embedded in fifty four of
the union list. therefore, it has been consistently held by this court that the declaration
under entry fifty four, parliament evinces an intention to occupy the field.
then kindly have the next one too.
the constitution bench in belsund sugar. this is again a constitution bench. examined the question
regarding the legality of levy of market fee under the provisions of bihar agricultural produce
markets act, nineteen sixty pertaining to various commodities including sugarcane, sugar, molasses, wheat and tea.
the court first dealt with the transaction of purchase of sugarcane by the sugar factories
functioning in the market areas falling within the jurisdiction of respective market committees constituted under
the market act. it noticed that the market act had been enacted by the bihar
legislature as per the legislative power mentioned in it by entries twenty six, twenty seven
and twenty eight of list ii of the seventh schedule of the constitution. the court,
however, noticed that the markets dealt with the supply and distribution of goods as well
as trade and commerce therein as it seeks to regulate the sale and purchase of
agricultural produce to be carried on in the specified markets under the act. to that
extent, the court said, the provisions of entry thirty three of list iii override the
legislative powers of the state legislature in connection with legislations dealing with trade and commerce
in, and the production, supply and distribution of goods.
thus, to the extent to which the market act seeks to regulate the transactions of
sale and purchase of sugarcane and sugar which are foodstuffs and trade and commerce therein,
the constitution bench said that it has to be held that the market act being
enacted under the topic of legislative powers under entries twenty six, twenty seven and twenty
eight of list ii will be subject to any other legislation under entry thirty three
of the concurrent list. the contention of mister dwivedi, however, that as admittedly the tobacco
is not foodstuff and does not fall under entry thirty three of list iii, like
the amendment to the constitution made in nineteen fifty three, the parliament by further amendment
of the constitution can, if so advised, place tobacco - raw material of the industry
- in entry thirty three of list iii and, thus, confer on itself the competence
to legislate in respect to tobacco, need not be examined by this court as being
unnecessary.
what we may, however, note that the constitution bench, after noticing various provisions of the
act and the rules, came to the conclusion that the need for regulating the purchase,
sales, storage and processing of sugarcane, being an agricultural produce, is completely met by the
comprehensive machinery provided by the sugarcane act enacted by the same very legislature which.
now, your lordship may perhaps.
then the paragraph eighty seven, they notice other decisions which have followed this logic.
eighty eight, the principles aforesaid would equally apply to entries fourteen, twenty seven, twenty eight,
and sixty six of list ii. it may further be noticed that in para one
hundred and seventy of belsund sugar company's case, the constitution bench reiterates the view expressed
in tika ramji's case as also in siel's case affirming full bench of the allahabad
high court in shriram industrial enterprises. in view of the above we see no compelling
reason either on account of binding preceding in the form of earlier constitution bench judgment,
history and background of the framing of the constitution or other words used in various
entries of the language of any article in the constitution of india, to take a
view which will result in denuding the power of state legislatures to legislate not in
respect of field of legislation under entry twenty four but field of legislation covered by
other entries in state list on making of declaration under entry fifty two of the
union list. the constitution bench judgment in the case of tika ramji and other decisions
following it confine the field of legislation of industries to 'the process of manufacture or
production' and not to 'raw materials'.in view of the aforesaid, i conclude as under.
the state legislations and the tobacco board act, nineteen seventy five to the extent of
sale of tobacco in market area cannot co-exist.
so tobacco board act is a central legislation. state legislation, and the tobacco board act
cannot co-exist.
the state legislatures are competent to enact legislations providing for sale of agricultural produce of
tobacco in market area and for levy and collection of market fee on that produce.
parliament is not competent.
kindly you look at this?
parliament is not competent to pass legislation in respect of goods enumerated in the aforesaid
conclusion no. two, while legislating in the field of legislation covered by entry fifty two
of the union list under which parliament can legislate only in respect of the industries,
namely 'the process of manufacture and production'.
so even though here parliamentary declaration law was not in question, yet they said parliament
cannot do it.
a declaration was issued.
my lords, once your lordships come to the conclusion that the scope of the entries
is to be delineated.
you can't delineate that in the light of the parliamentary legislation.
then again, the question would be under which entry the law falls.
and if lordships come to the conclusion that encroaches on the state list, it has
to.
and that is where the question of your lordship in jayant verma's case, the dominant
legislature will always have the power despite the fact that there is a parliamentary legislation
covering the ancillary and incidental factors.
justice ruma pal's judgment from para one hundred and ten onwards, it's is a very
illuminating.
your lordships may also have para ninety four.
which had come earlier, but then i would. sixteen forty seven.
but ninety four is very clear.
although parliament cannot legislate on any of the entries in state list, it may do
so incidentally while essentially legislating within the entries under union list. conversely, the state legislature
will encroach on the union list when such an encroachment is merely ancillary to an
excise of power intrinsically in the state list. the fact of encroachment does not affect
the vires of the law.
even as regards the area of encroachment.
this principle, commonly known as doctrine of pith and substance does not amount to extension
of the field of legislation.
it does not amount to extension of the legislative fields.
therefore, such incidental encroachment in either event does not deprive the state legislature in the
first case or parliament in the second, of their exclusive powers under the entry so
encroached upon.
in the event the incidental encroachment conflicts with legislation actually enacted by the dominant power,
the dominant legislation will prevail.
i'll tell you, as we are rising today that is the heart of what we
have to consider.
that's something which is worrying me.
and we're still open on this aspect.
my lord, i thought i had closed it down.
just maybe five minutes tomorrow on this.
the process of reflection never stops until the last word is said.
tika ramji said that the word 'industry' means 'the process of manufacture or production' and
that it does not include the raw materials used in the industry or the distribution
of the products of the industry.
the distribution of the products is entry twenty six and twenty seven.
raw materials was not covered by entry fifty two, that is tika ramji. if you
come down now to itc which we are reading.
itc dealt with the market fairs because of the agricultural produce market committee. justice ruma
pal and the other judgment, justice sabharwal says that applying the logic of tika ramji,
the regulation of markets and fairs under entry twenty eight.
are not subject to entry fifty two.
are not covered by industry, right?
and therefore, entry sixty six, the power to levy market fees is preserved for the
states that is itc. the real problem, which we are.
the conundrum which we face is this that entry fifty two covers production, manufacture, expressly,right?
entry eight covers production, manufacture expressly.
so, there's a complete overlap between entry fifty two and entry eight.
now, one answer to that is this that if you read therefore, both of them
as overlapping and entry fifty two as having predominance where entry eight is rendered otiose.
but where the two entries are so completely overlapping because both cover production and manufacture,
entry eight expressly, entry fifty two by interpretation that we have placed since tika ramji,
then what will prevail?
no. kindly have entry fifty two once again my lord, for just a minute.
entry fifty two.
you see tika ramji and all the cases subsequently were able to skirt around this
issue because there is no absolute overlap.
tika ramji was before then this last judgment is after markets and fees.
this is a case which is directly and squarely an overlap between the two.
that is the problem which.
that may not be the correct due of tika ramji. in every case, my lord,
right from tika ramji till date what the union and the petitioners have emphasized is
that entry fifty two will include not only manufacturing.
just while we are rising, just see justice ruma pal's judgment.
paragraph one hundred and twenty six and then we'll rise.
and we'll also reflect upon it in the night.
to sum up, learned judge says, at page sixteen fifty nine.
to sum up, the word industry, for the purposes of entry fifty two of list
i has been firmly confined by tika ramji to the process of manufacture production only.
subsequently, decisions, including those of our other constitution benches have reaffirmed that tika ramji's case
authoritatively defined the word 'industry' to mean 'the process of manufacture or production', and that
it does not include raw material used in the industry or the distribution of the
product.
given the constitutional framework and weight of the judicial authority, it is not possible to
accept the argument canvassing a wider meaning.
my lord, this is the critical.
just go ahead.
to accept argument canvassing a wider meaning of the word industry, whatever the word may
mean in the other context, it must be understood in the constitutional aspect as meaning
manufacture or production.
now just see para one hundred and twenty seven.
applying the negative test as evolved in the tika ramji in this case, it would
follow that the word 'industry' in entry twenty four, list ii, and consequently, entry fifty
two of list i does not and cannot be read to include entry twenty eight
and sixty six of list ii, which has been expressly marked out as fields within
the state's exclusive.
my lords this is the.
just read that para, then we'll read.
as noted earlier, entry twenty eight deals with markets and fairs and entry sixty six
with the right to levy fee in respect of in present context, markets and fairs.
entry fifty two of list i does not override entry twenty eight in list ii
nor has entry twenty eight in list ii been made subject to entry fifty two,
unlike entry twenty four of list ii. this court in belsund has also accepted the
argument, entry twenty eight of list ii operated in its own and cannot be affected
by any legislation pertaining to industry.
my lord, this part.
now just see para one hundred and twenty, just one sentence.
if 'industry' does not include markets and fairs, it is important to define what markets
and fairs.
then learned judge discusses this.
therefore, all these judgments really say that look, entry fifty two does not cover the
activity which is being legislated upon by the state. and therefore, in one case, raw
materials the state can legislate, markets and fairs the states can legislate.
we are now in a situation where both are exactly on all fours together, production
and manufacture.
please have a relook at calcutta gas and mcdowell. then what happens?
there they are dealing with industry.
in calcutta gas, constitution bench was dealing with industry, gas and gas works.
entry twenty five list ii. there are two possible answers.
one, is to say which is the pro state, or we say the pro-federal principle
that if the entry is not made subject to a central entry then the state
entry must have its full operation.
the other is to apply.
though the constitution is federal, the constitution is federal with a certain weight in favour
of the centre and then say that where the two entries overlap then article two
forty six (one) will prevail because it covers exactly the overlapping field.
there are two opposing viewpoints.
question is, which one to adopt?
i'll come back tomorrow morning with fresh ammunition perhaps, my lords. another tentative answer, my
lords, if i may offer.
just one second, brother. chief justice has given you a lot of food for thoughts,
mister dwivedi. definitely, my lord but.
i may provide you some drink for thoughts.
you are talking about different intoxicating liquor, some require ageing, some does not require ageing.
some are fair, some are dark.
but perhaps it may not be comprehensible to some members of the bench. would material
exhibit help?
the best thing would be, my lord, to send a bottle to each one of
the.
this is all in lighter vein.
i told brother jamshed, as we were rising for the lunch, that you have become
a domain expert by mister dwivedi's argument.
i'm.
certainly i must admit that i am fond of liquor.
i don't mind claiming that.
i seek, my lord. in a lighter vein, my lord, we had a trademark case,
so we brought actual bottles to show the court and went for lunch, by the
time we came back, they all were consumed.
i seek, my lords. i seek, my lord, in this matter i'm appearing for ut
of puducherry. the registry is not accepting my vakalat. may i be permitted to.
yes. obliged, my lord.
