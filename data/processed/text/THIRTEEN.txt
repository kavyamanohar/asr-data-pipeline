my lord, this is about that automatic vacation of stay, my lords, not
only in criminal matters, but civil matters and across the board, my lords.
yes, asian resurfacing. yes.
i need not place those judgments, my lords, the asian resurfacing, my lords,
because in the interim order your lordships have elaborated the contents and from
a reading of the first judgment itself, it appears that that was a
case where the only question was whether against an interlocutory order, an appeal
could be filed, a revision could be filed or article 226, 227 could be entertained.
that was in the context of pc act.
there was no issue of any civil proceedings arising in that.
there was no issue equally, my lord, what should be done with the interim
orders, of course it appears that in the course of arguments, the aspect of delay.
nobody can deny that proceedings are getting delayed in the high courts, especially in
some high courts like the allahabad high court and patna high court and so on.
and the delays are. the judges also were.
that is what was weighing with them.
otherwise, stays just continue for decades to an end, particularly in the larger high courts.
and sometimes the delays are on account of the fact that
the accused person would get an interim order and that continues.
so, they take advantage of it, the trials get frustrated, witnesses.
long time lapse, my lords, the memories of the witnesses will fade.
in some cases my lords, the respondents, the state is the culprit, my lord.
they don't file affidavits promptly and sometimes also, especially in
the courts which i have mentioned, it is systemic fault.
fault itself could be for more than one reason, my lord, because there
are 160 vacant posts in the high court of allahabad and only 90 judges.
filing is enormous.
filing is enormous matters don't get listed sometimes my lord, and
sometimes when they're listed, my lord, the judges are overloaded with work.
150 cases.
in allahabad, the problem is magnified that the same issue, whether justice oka was
saying in karnataka, i know that same issue in the larger high courts like mumbai.
and not the fault of judges or for that matter, the litigant, because if
there are 200 matters on board every day, 150 matters, 200 matters and you
have to write some reasons, give some order which shows deliberation, application of mind.
it's impossible for the entire to be completed.
and allahabad is compounded by the strikes.
the lawyers, my lord, i have the secretary,
nitin sharma is here, who is this instrumental filing.
in fact, my lord, a very sad episode happened.
and that goes back long time ago justice misra and justice mithal are aware.
absolutely.
so, for months together the strikes used to
go on, and at a drop of hat.
no longer actually. i don't think after 2000 and.
chief justice sodhi, my lord, was the person who.
despite so many judgements, i don't know why lawyers adopt this trade unionism tool.
so, it's not that once a while it happens.
it happens quite frequently and regularly, my lord.
mr. dwivedi, what is to be done, then what is the solution?
because if a judge grants a stay in a 482, it
virtually means that nothing is going to come up in the next.
the first question, which perhaps your lordships will have to look
into is do we find a solution, my lord, which is.
creates greater problem. worse than. which is worse than the disease.
it results in one more round, again.
we have to create in every discipline, civil, revisions, appeals and tax
and a separate bench, which will consider now the extension of same
amount of time and the court says in resurfacing, give reasons while
extending which really means, my lord, that both sides have to be heard.
it's not like that we're not able to take up, then we
say extend it till the next date automatically and that can happen
in any court, my lord, even in this court, it can happen.
it doesn't matter, for some reason, some important matter is going on,
other matters are not taken up, your lordship, normally ask, my lord,
if any extension is required, it is extended in the normal course.
so, the judges are not to be blamed.
they are making the best efforts, my lord, in the difficult circumstances.
granted interim relief after it was argued prima facie.
yes.
so, when it comes up for extension, even if it's another bench,
it's a principle of judicial respect for the fact that even assuming
that the stay has granted by another bench, it has applied in mind.
yes.
so, that's one important question, my lord, do we come out with some
formula etc., which in this matter, results in a vacation of a stay
order with application of mind and what is this formula, my lords, automatic.
neither, the supreme court is applying its mind because it's a kind
of a judicial legislation, automatic vacate for all cases, for all times.
so, because of this, the court is not.
this court is not applying its mind to the facts of that particular
case, and high court is also not applying and the second resurfacing which
followed, this court directs the magistrates that, 'you have to implement this, proceed.'
in some states, there are contempt petitions filed against the hon'ble judges because
of the direction that 'it is the responsibility of the concerned learned judge
to proceed.' some litigants, my lord, in punjab, haryana, in three or four
states, contempt petitions are filed, joining the hon'ble
judges, the judges who were to conduct trial.
so, i join my learned friend, my lord.
the solution, perhaps, is, my lord, more severe than the disease.
we need to find out a solution, but this definitely is not the solution.
so, i submit that this automatic reservation is no solution.
neither practically nor on a legal plane.
what do you have to say about article 226(3)?
that's what i. the first question is, that
article 226 is a basic feature of the constitution.
if 226(3) is to be applied, then it will
have to be tested whether that can be done.
if article 226 is part of the basic structure which
this court has repeatedly held, it is, so it cannot
be taken away, it cannot be whittled down, neither by constitutional amendment.
this is something like indira gandhi's case where, now by
constitutional amendment, you are deciding that it will get automatically vacated.
so who is applying the mind? it is interference with the process of judicial review.
so, if challenged, it will be liable to be struck down.
but the high courts, in some cases which we
have cited have, therefore, said that this is directory.
bombay high court has also taken that.
madras high court. this provision came in by the 44th amendment?
yes. so, i think that's the best solution to leave it as directory.
otherwise we'll have to amend the petition and question 226(3) as ultra vires.
368 cannot be used to bring in a provision of this nature but
in a way, the direction in asia resurfacing, goes much beyond article 226(3).
226(3) says that, upon the making of an application by the other
side to vacate, if then it is not decided in 15 days.
here it is not required.
the other side has to just sleep over for six months.
it'll get vacated.
so, technically, even if it is ex parte,
after six months of stay, it would be vacated.
in many cases, it has happened.
that's why in the second case this court went
ahead logically to direct the magistrates to proceed, implement.
the judgements are there before your lordships, perhaps this may also be necessary
for your lordships to consider in this with the constitution bench, whether 226(3)
is mandatory or directory because there are diverse opinions among the various high courts.
although judgments are also there before your lordships, by way of a compilation
filed by me. that will result in widening of this court, my lord.
maybe, but that will be relevant thing also.
possibly that's not the question right now, 226(3) .
then we'll have to come with a petition questioning the validity of 226(3).
no, that's an interpretation of 226(3). no. mere interpretation.
then we'll like to challenge the validity.
but if it is to be interpreted, then it is directory.
and the high courts have given good reasons.
two high courts have given good reasons.
see the provision before the amendment, that is
in the footnote to this scc, ebc copy.
if you have the red book with you, you have this red one?
this earlier provision is in the footnote.
this is very good. it gives all the footnotes.
mr. dwivedi can read it from this book.
it's at page 186. the earlier provision said that if you have not.
for the redress of any injury referred to in subclause b or c
of clause 1 shall be entertained, if any other remedy for such redress.
that's alternate remedy. or under law for time being enforced.
now see 4 and 5.
no, interim order shall, whether by way of injunction or stay or
in any other manner shall be made in any proceedings relating to
a petition under clause 1, unless copies of such petition and of
all documents in support of plea for such interim order are furnished
to the party against whom such petition is filed or proposed to be filed.
opportunity is given such party to be heard in.
that's fine, my lords. now see how 5 was.
5 was very carefully framed.
the high court may dispense with the requirements of sub-clauses a, b of clause 4
and make an interim order, in writing, that it is necessary so, to do, for
preventing any loss being caused to the petitioner which cannot be adequately compensated in money.
but any such interim order shall, if it is not vacated earlier, cease to
have effect on the expiry of the period of 14 days from the date
on which it is made, unless the said requirements have been complied with before
the expiry of that period and high court
has continued the operation of the interim order.
so that's. the amendment which your lordship sees, which is now there.
see, this amendment will apply only when interim is granted without , without hearing.
so therefore, if there is a notice issued or in some high courts
practice is to serve state in advance, this will not apply at all.
a copy is given and notice is served, then this will not apply.
yes. we don't need to go into.
we will not go to 226(3), my lords
in this matter, it operates in a different way.
and in very limited cases it will apply.
yes.
because once a and b is complied with,
then there is no question of an automatic vacation.
in high courts, in most high courts.
i'll tell your. my lord, i would submit before your lordships why it's not necessary.
asian resurfacing essentially concentrates on stay of trials.
stay of trials would arise either in 482 or other jurisdiction.
227. 227. not in 226.
226, my lord, we would be taking support to substantiate other submissions,
just to say my lords, that first it's a part of the constitution.
here it's a judicial continuing mandamus.
second, there is at least a requirement of
an aggrieved party applied for vacating the stay.
here. automatic, without. .
who is not vigilant enough and sits for six months
is put to premium by getting the stay against him vacated.
he has to do nothing, except being negligent, to put it a little harshly.
that's the position. som 226, may perhaps not require your lordships' attention in this matter.
my lord, the copies are served in advance on the state council.
absolutely. except in private disputes.
otherwise, their state councils are always served and they have an opportunity of being heard.
it's other matter that the state government advocates may not
have been having instructions, etc., so they get time, my lord.
anything in particular that you would like to add?
my lord, only two or three things.
my lord, i have not stated. alright, we'll hear you.
how would you like to summate the submission then, mr. dwivedi?
i have seven points, my lord. seven points?
alright, just tell us. one second. the judgments are mentioned in my written submission.
i will not be taking your lordships through it.
the propositions are all well settled and well known to your lordships.
first is that this direction amounts. which is that volume, mr. dwivedi, your written submissions?
separate volume. it's a separate volume. high court bar.
yes. they were allowed to intervene in the high court, my lords.
correct.
the first submission is that this direction of
automatic vacation is laying down of a general norm.
direction for?
automatic vacation of interim order lays down a general norm
and therefore, it is in the nature of judicial legislation
and this court, my lord, does not engage in judicial legislation.
yes. in the same sex matter, my lord, your lordships have elaborated.
i don't need to, my lords.
the second submission, my lord, that article 226 is a part of
the basic structure of the constitution and it can neither be shut
out or nor whittled nor whittled down either by constitutional amendment or by legislation.
and ought not to be shut out or whittled
down in exercise of powers under article 141 and 142.
this is also because my lord, the high court.
this is the third point or the second point?
third point. third point. it's part of the same point, my lord.
alright.
this is because the high court enjoys a high constitution
status and it's not subordinate, my lord, to the supreme court.
this also, has been held in several judgments.
so, merely because there is a problem arising, that doesn't
mean that the power of the high court should be curtailed.
and there should be any kind of a general direction that even if you
have not applied, even if you have not vacated, we are saying it will
stand vacated and even we will not apply our mind, it will get automatically vacated.
yes.
so, the third point, therefore is, that the automatic vacation is neither hinged
on application of mind by the high court nor by the supreme court.
and application of mind is the essence of judicial
decision making without which the decision would be arbitrary.
so, even though article 14, etc., fundamental rights are not
available to test the judicial dictums, yet, your lordships have
consistently observed that arbitrariness in decision making is to be avoided.
the fourth point is, the arbitrariness and the discriminatory character
of this direction arises from the fact that it lumps
together all sorts of cases, civil, criminal, tax, irrespective of facticity.
irrespective? of facticity of the cases, nature of jurisdiction and determination of fault.
for if i am delaying, my lord, i, having obtained interim order twice, thrice.
i can understand high court vacates it, not by
an automatic direction, but high court vacates it because.
then, the next is, my lord, speedy trial includes early termination of vexatious trial, also.
and this direction does not reasonably balance the two aspects.
so, both section 482 and 226 are available for quashing of
firs and charge sheets and so, even charges in an appropriate case.
so, one can understand that the court may be directed
to be slow or to give reasons or to hear.
so, these are three, four directions, which can be and should be
rather introduced so that straight away or maybe it can also be
said that is, heinous crimes and serious financial irregularities cases or economic
offenses, if an interim order is to be given, it should be
initially for a short period, as your lordship says, till the next date of listing.
so, that an opportunity, effective opportunity is there.
government counsel may not be having instructions so.
and that will not prevent the high court from granting appropriate relief.
the relief can vary.
sometimes it can be arrest, sometimes it can be staying the whole proceedings.
it all depends upon the circumstances.
because we have also seen that there are cases where matters have been settled up
to the supreme court and people still my lords, fight it out by filing firs.
they resort to criminal proceedings, civil nature disputes, they are all carried only to harass.
so, if in such cases a direction is given, till further orders.
all that power is there under 226.
so, there has to be a proper balancing and some minimal directions alone
should be given so that there is a guidance to the high court.
and lastly, this ignores two precedents, my lords.
though, in the context of trial and not interim order.
that is antulay's case and p. ramachandra rao.
at page 4 of my written submission, in paragraph
4, i have given the paragraphs at the footnote.
i will stress only para 82, 83, 86, 93 and
94 of antulay's case, that is (1992) 1 scc 225.
in your submissions, where is it, you said?
paragraph 4, i'll very briefly state it, my lords.
two constitution benches in a.r. antulay's case and p. ramachandra rao have while
dealing with the fundamental right to speedy trial under article 21, held that
it is not permissible for this court to fix time limits for completion of trials.
the reason assigned is that delay in trial could happen for a variety of reasons.
may i read these two judgments. no. it's a very well settled law.
p. ramachandra rao may be seen only, because after antulay's case came, three
judgments of this court, where this court identically, as in asian resurfacing, proceeded
to say if trial is not completed in 360 days, then trial will terminate.
so, the matter went back to p. ramachandra
rao and they said that this is judicial legislation.
it's in your convenience compilation? yes, it is there in the compilation.
pdf 1399. my lords, will find the reference.
the issue which was involved and that towards the
middle your lordships will find raj deo sharma 1, 2.
all these cases, they said, if not concluded, will terminate.
then, in paragraph 19, antulay's case is noted, and placitum f, if your lordship
comes to placitum f, there are other factors contributing to the delay at the trial.
so, all these various reasons for delays are
noted and the court says, it's all relative.
first is non availability of the counsel, non-availability of accused, interlocutory proceedings, other systemic delays.
in addition, court noted that in certain cases
there may be a large number of witnesses.
in some offences by their very nature, the evidence may be lengthy.
in kartar singh, another constitution bench opined that delay is dependent
on the circumstances of each case because reasons for delay will vary.
such as one delay in investigation on account of the widespread
ramifications of the crime and is designed network, either nationally or internationally.
the deliberate absence of witness or witnesses, crowded dockets on the
file of the court, etc. so, all that is said, my lords.
and then paragraph 20, 'several cases coming to our notice while hearing appeals, petitions
and miscellaneous petitions such as for bail and quashing of proceedings revealed, apart from
inadequate judge strength, other factors contributing to the delay at trial, generally speaking, these
are absence of or delay in. again, those reasons are mentioned. and then 21,
the question is posed, is it at all necessary to have limitation bars terminating
trial and proceedings? is there no effective mechanism available for achieving the same end?
the criminal procedure code as it stands incorporates a few provisions to which resort
can be had for protecting the interest of accused and saving him from unreasonable
prolixity or laxity at the trial amounting to oppression.' section 309
is then referred to, your lordships can then leave the rest.
please come to 22.
legislation is that source of law which consists in the declaration of legal.
again, this definition of. and then the court holds.
last line at page 1421, 'bars of limitation, judicially engrafted are no doubt
meant to provide a solution to the aforementioned problems. but a solution of
this nature gives rise to greater problems, like scuttling. a trial without adjudications,
stultifying access to justice and giving easy exit from the solution, from the
portals of justice. such general remedial measures cannot be said to be apt
solutions. for two reasons we hold that such bars of limitations are uncalled
for, impermissible. first because it tantamounts to impermissible legislation an activity beyond the
power of the constitution conferred on the judiciary. and secondly, because such bars
of limitation fly in the face of law laid
down by the constitution bench in a.r. antulay's case.
therefore, run counter to doctrine of precedent.
' there's a quote from william wade, judicial
activism and so on, i can leave it.
and then 27, prescribing periods of limitation at the end of which the trial
court would be obliged to terminate the proceedings and necessarily grant, acquit or discharge
the accused and further making such directions applicable to all the cases in the
present and for the future amounts to legislation which, in our opinion, cannot be
done by judicial directives and within the arena
of judicial lawmaking power available to the constitutional gods.
howsoever liberally we may interpret article 32, 21, 141,
142 of the constitution, the dividing line is but perceptible.
courts can declare the law, they can interpret the law, they
can remove obvious lacuna and fill the gaps, but they cannot
entrench upon the field of legislation properly meant for the legislature.
binding directions can be issued, for enforcing the law in appropriate directions may issue, including
laying down of time limits or chalking out a calendar for proceeding to redeem the
injustice done or for taking care of rights violated in a case, in a given
case or set of cases, depending on facts brought to the notice of the court.
this is permissible for the judiciary to do
so, but it may not like the legislative.
legislature, enact a provision, akin to or on the lines
of chapter 36 of the code of criminal procedure, 1973.
the other reason why the bars of limitation enacted in common cause,
common cause -2, raj deo sharma -1, raj deo sharma -2 cannot
be sustained is that these decisions though, two or three judge decisions
run counter to the extent to the dictum of the constitution bench in antulay's case.
therefore, cannot be said to be good law to the
extent they are in breach of the doctrine of precedents.
the well settled principle of precedents, which are crystallized into a rule of law.
now, that's known, my lords.
and then, they affirm the directions, my lords, in paragraph 29.
so, my lords, it's somewhat similar.
these kind of directions are actually judicial legislations, something
which even article 368 will not include within its fold.
yes. and that is, my lords. apart from these submissions.
what happens is in the course of it, my lord, that
by issuing these directions, we are not enabling the high courts
to conduct themselves in appropriately, my lord, in dealing with the
case, but rather disabling them and downgrading their status, over the course of years.
and in one such matter, in this court itself when chief justice khehar was,
i think vijay was there, was retiring there was some letter, my lord, from
the law minister, and regarding selections of judicial officers in the high courts and
the rules to be made and then the committee of judges of this court
that accepted that proposition favourably and immediately, a suo moto petition was listed and
justice goel was chairman of the committee also,
and he sat on the bench also immediately.
and this was just a few days before the chief justice was retiring,
the matter went on for two days, and there were so many judges.
i said, how can you intervene?
how can you take over the power of the high court?
it was a very serious matter.
and ultimately, it's the second case where the bench was disbanded, after that kesavananda .
yes.
just after the lunch, then he inquired, do you
really think this requires serious consideration and we must.
i said, don't be hasty in this matter.
for the last so many years, this has been continuing.
even if you want to change, please consider it carefully and then come out.
so, there is some kind of a tendency sometimes that
we try to limit the powers of the high courts.
what we really need is that the high courts should be getting on with
their functions and discharging their duties and functions and powers under the constitution more effectively.
i don't need to elaborate, your lordships are all more
aware than me what is happening in various high courts.
but then these are not the solutions at all.
let's not curb the high court.
the time is to rebuild the high court and put them, my
lord, on a strong footing so that high courts function like high courts.
they are ultimately. there is some kind of.
of course, there's no such federalism in the judicial field as we have in the.
judiciary is structured differently, my lord.
it has some various elements of unitary operations, but at the
same time the high court is the ultimate court in the state.
80 or 90% of the litigants are not able to come to the supreme court.
now, therefore, we don't need to not keep on.
different methods have to be found.
able judges, less strikes, more lawyers because we don't have hearing.
i wonder what will happen after some time
if the high courts are not having final hearings.
we used to sit, when i was in law, first year,
first day i used to come and i heard the whole
of kesavananda bharati and i used to sit with the register behind.
so, by hearing, even in high courts, we have learned
from the seniors how they are arguing, how they are responding.
but today, what we are finding is less of arguments and interim orders.
people don't understand what happened in one case,
what happened, why not in the other case.
so, ultimately, that part somehow, in some way, has to be tackled.
unless the high courts are put on rails as constitutionally imagined by the
framers of the constitution, there will be dark days for this court my lord.
ultimately, high courts are the feeding source for this court, main feeding source.
so, let's put high court on the rails, strengthen them.
that's the only solution. not this kind of stickling, my lord, that after.
somebody suggests that after three adjournments, it should be automatically vacated.
so, we are distrusting the high court judges.
all these propositions show that we don't have trust on the high court judges.
somehow we feel something wrong is happening there.
there's a similar provision actually, in the central excise act, or which was
then dealt with several high courts that there can't be an automatic vacation
of stay merely because the court is not able to apply its mind.
at page five, my lord, your lordships will find pepsi.
that was read down, my lord, by this court.
at 5 page, pepsi. pepsi, my lord.
that's right, pepsi. 2021. and surprising, my lords, i was surprised.
justice nariman went down that line, accepted that proposition.
he believes in basic structure.
and in this second case, at paragraph 6 of my written submission.
in pepsi, justice nariman himself said that.
diluted it, struck down portions of it, and said that only if there
is fault of the applicant, then it will stand automatically vacated, not otherwise.
so, he adopted the fault principle. so, there are two problems.
one, the automatic vacation of stay prejudices a
litigant, irrespective of the conduct of that litigant.
because there are circumstances of which the litigant
has no control and yet many times, systemic flaws.
as a result of which, irrespective of what the litigant has in terms
of infrastructure available to him or her, stays are vacated by this logic.
and second the vacation. the vacating of an order of stay, is also judicial act.
the vacating of an order of stay, is not an administrative act.
so, by directing that the stay will stand vacated,
without application of mind, a judicial order is enforced.
as a result of which, notwithstanding the fact that the earlier benches
have applied it's mind, given reasons for the interim order, applied it's.
there's judicial application of mind to what the prima facie merits of the case were.
subsequently, the stay is vacated without any application of mind.
normally, when we vacate an order of stay,
you give reasons for vacating order of stay.
maybe that the litigant had abused his.
you know. abused that process or he had concealed facts from the court.
and every day, we are having appeals here against interim
bails granted, bails granted and interim orders also people are coming.
actually it amounts to withdrawing high court's jurisdiction.
taken away. absolutely.
it is actually, my lord, great distrust in the high court, which is reflected.
that's why i was compelled to make that those submissions.
great deference my lords. it's actually indicating distrust in the high court judges.
so, why are we having the high courts at all, my lords?
in fact, that's why many of us don't lay down
outer time limits for the high courts to decide cases.
in fact. endeavour to do so and like that,my lords.
and even when it is said, my lords, in
clear terms, yet your lordships consider it to be directory.
it's not that a judgment will be set aside merely
because it has transgressed 365 days and comes after 367 days.
that's why i was compelled, my lords.
these solutions, let's not find solutions, let the high court have
that full wide jurisdiction, which your lordships have said under 226.
ultimately, even this court will get clogged, if
there are four benches extending orders every time.
then there will be so many more slps coming in,
your lordships precious time will be involved in dealing with them.
power to grant interim order is. this is the last, my lords.
the power to grant interim order is inherent in article 226, 227 and 482.
it doesn't stand outside it. that is only to preserve and protect.
285 my lords, the high court has dealt with this aspect
of interim orders, your lordships may just note 285 to 287.
they have noted. pdf 311. in the same compilation or convenience compilation.
or the and i must commend, my lord, the judgment is very exhaustive, though
a little bit lengthy, but it deals with a high court dealing with a
supreme court judgment, my lords, has to be careful with all due care and.
a very well written judgment, my lords.
13 of my written note, my lords, at
page seven in fazalullah khan vs akbar contractor.
the question was whether this direction will apply
to interim orders granted by supreme court itself.
it will not apply to 32.
so, 32, 226, ultimately, both are very important constitutional powers.
that observation is per incuriam because there was no such issue involved in that issue.
this was not an issue before the bench at all.
so, following what your lordships said in article 370 case about prem nath kaul's judgement.
i'll not take more than five, seven minutes, my lord.
yes. i have filed an intervention application.
if you don't mind, can i complete?
can i complete? can we complete this side?
there is no side here. there is no side.
there is no side really.
let the solicitor complete, then we'll hear you for five minutes.
i'll just summarize, my lord.
for your lordship's convenience, i have made certain bullet points which
i had mailed today in the morning and i'm not going
to read any of them, at the outset, i may say.
my lord, my first respectful submission is that by a judicial mandamus or
a continuing mandamus, the judicial discretion of the high court cannot be curtailed.
i'm sorry.
your lordships, my lord, high court would be dealing either in 227 or 482?
i'm sorry, my lord, today it is reversed, your
lordships have physical copies and i am not having.
but i am at fault, my lord.
i'll invite your lordships attention only to few points, my lord.
my lord, suppose in a 227 or a 482 jurisdiction, an accused approaches
the court saying that there is no valid sanction, high court is satisfied
and high court says that, 'till the sanction is granted, trial not to
proceed. the six month period, my lord, the judgment takes away the discretion
of the high court to say that the stay would inure a particular
date, which is beyond the reach of the applicant. second, indore development authority,
my lord, a recent judgment has recognized the principle of actus curiae neminem
gravabit. your lordships are aware, of that 'act of the court can prejudice no one.
' yes.
my lord, a somewhat similar situation was there under the new land
acquisition act, that period of five years from the stay granted by
the high court was to be excluded and court said that it's
not in the litigant's hand when the stay would be vacated, when
it could be granted modified, etc. so, my lord, that is my second point.
coming to page two of my note, there is a constitution bench judgment which
asian resurfacing misses to note that is raza buland sugar company vs municipal board, rampur.
proposition is simple in that judgment, that nothing can be
done behind the back of, or in absence of the litigant.
yes.
my lord, on 180th day, 6 months period, matter may be on
board, matter may not be on board, he would not be aware of.
and by operation of the direction, my lord, the stay would get vacated.
that is contrary to this constitution bench judgement.
my lord, at page 2, i have cited one paragraph of
sharif-ud-din vs abdul gani lone, if your lordships can allow me
to place it, para 69, that is in my respectful submission, fully applicable.
therefore, it is clear that if the condition imposed by the provision of
law, this was statutory law, this is continuing mandamus, to do a certain
thing within a time frame is upon an institution, and the consequences of
that institution not complying with the condition is to fall upon someone else,
who have no control over the institution, which is to perform the duty,
then the provision of law cannot be construed as mandatory but only directory.
here, the litigant has no control and even court has no control over his list.
the lists are beyond human potential. next judgment is, my lord, pepsi food.
my lord, there section 254. yes.
my lord, there was an amendment in the income tax act, section 254(2a), was
inserted, that a stay granted by the tribunal would get automatically vacated after one year.
and high court.
this hon'ble court, said this, and this, i would respectfully
place for your lordships' consideration, such provision treats unequals equally.
yes.
the person who has an interim order inuring in his
favour, has once persuaded the competent court to grant it.
the respondent has done nothing to get that vacated.
so, unequals are being treated as equals.
and therefore, also, this needs to. this is not a correct law.
then next point is, whenever any court passes an order, it
passes broadly strong prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injuries.
after six months whether those conditions, these three conditions, change or not,
the judgment says it stays vacated without any application of judicial mind.
because after six months, the case will not
become weak, it would remain strong unless heard.
balance of convenience also would not tilt within.
because, merely because six months have passed.
and injury also, my lord. yes.
next point is, my lord, whenever the judgment which
mr. dwivedi relied upon, i also respectfully rely upon.
but i'm not reading that judgment. yes.
whenever a time frame is to be stipulated,
it is always for the competent legislature to do.
but even those have been held to be by and large directory.
directory. for example, my lord. the ibc, insolvency and bankruptcy code.
ibc or arbitration act. the consumer protection act.
consumer.
after particular days, your right to file appeal goes, because of
the overall scheme of the act, the intent of the legislation,
etc., etc. because there is one focused area which the court is examining.
this is, my lord, too wide an area.
it can be a civil suit, it can be a criminal trial,
it can be criminal revision, it can be 482, it can be
civil revision under 115, it can be superintendent's jurisdiction under article 227.
but nothing is considered, and a judicial mandamus is issued.
generally speaking, directions for the completion of a trial proceeding by
the legislature within a certain stipulated period is held to be directory.
but since an appeal is a creature of a statute, directions for
the legislative prescriptions for filing of appeals on limitation have been held
to be mandatory, like in section 34(3) of the arbitration act or section 61.
61 of the insolvency and bankruptcy code.
the curtain falls. you know.
you can condone a delay up to 15 days, beyond 30 days, but no further.
because time is the essence of that particular legislation.
so, time fixation, first of all, has to be by the competent legislature.
and, for the purpose of the object which that particular act seeks to achieve.
it is always object specific.
then, my lord, your lordships are aware, order 8,
rule 1, required that unless you file your written statement.
yes. the court can extend only for 30 days.
that came to be challenged.
i'll read, my lords, only four lines, when, my lord, this hon'ble court dealt
with, my lords, the challenge, that your lordships would find at page 4, that
the citation is kailash vs nanhku, (2005) 4
scc 480, para 27, only last three lines.
that is relevant for the entire discussion.
but i don't wish to my lord, take time
on that my lord, but last three lines are crucial.
the object is to expedite the hearing and not to scuttle the same.
the process of justice may be speeded up and hurried, but the fairness,
which is a basic element of justice, cannot be permitted to be buried.
this kailash judgement, my lords, mr. dwivedi was the amicus.
so, my lord, any judicial discretion, should be left, to the concerned court, namely
the high court and in some cases, my lords, the district court, but generally
the question of stay of trial does not arise in case of proceedings before
the district court, except in case of a criminal revision or some civil revision.
generally, it is high court. yes.
so, my lord, while the problem is there, trials are stayed
and it has its own ramifications but this is not the solution.
these are my respectful. thank you, mr. solicitor.
yes, mr. hansaria.
my lord, i appear in the i.a. number 258440 of 2023
on behalf of guwahati high court bar association and we are
supporting my lord, both mr. dwivedi and the learned solicitor, my lord.
just to add one or two aspects.
my lord, wherever limitation is provided, it is upon the litigant.
your lordships, courts have put a fetter on the litigant.
section 34, arbitration act, appeal and not upon the courts, my lord.
if your lordships see the sweep of the directions
in asian resurfacing, my lord, in the compilation page 29.
if i can read that, five lines from that judgment.
if your lordships go to the convenience compilation of mr.
dwivedi, the judgment started at page 3 of the compilation.
at page 29, just before paragraph 38, your lordships would see this sweep.
what page will that be? page 29.
just before.
just starting, 'in all pending matters before the high courts.', my lords have got it?
yes.
'in all pending matters before the high courts or other courts, which will
include special courts, etc., relating to the pc act and all other civil
or criminal cases, where stay of proceedings in a pending trial is operating,
stay will automatically lapse after six months from today.' the judgment is, my
lord, delivered, 'unless extended by speaking order on
the above parameters.' now, next line is also important.
'same course may also be adopted by civil and criminal appellate revisional courts
under the jurisdiction of the high courts, the trial courts may, on expiry
of the period, resume the proceedings without waiting for further intimation' my lords.
sweep of the direction.
your lordships would see the consequence on a diligent litigant, my lord.
he convinces the court, passes an interim order.
thereafter, listed after one month, it does not reach or the respondent seeks an adjournment.
the court is not able to take it up, despite being
on the board, i wait for the entire day, it doesn't reach.
it happens in so many courts, both of.
all of the lordships knows so, my lord.
so, my lord as the learned attorney has rightly said that
it is upon the institution, my lord, whether it is able
to decide it or within that six months’ time limit or not.
anything else? only one thing, my lord.
wherever the courts find that peremptory order is upon again the judicial discretion.
sometimes, your lordships and courts pass it will operate for
a period of six months or my lord, four weeks.
that qualification is given in the order itself that this stay
will operate for a period of four weeks and it expires automatically.
that judicial discretion is available to the court, which this court in asian resurfacing.
that it automatically vacates, wherever the court wants, it should
automatically vacate, that is stipulated in the order itself, sometimes
by your lordships, my lord, while exercising that discretion of the court.
so, it cannot automatically vacate by virtue of this.
we do it so often over here, instead of saying, notice
returnable in six weeks, because if you say notice returnable after
six weeks, sometimes we found that matters were coming back after five years.
yes, my lord it has happened.
so, we list it on a particular day and say that the interim
order will be up to a particular day, so we have control over it.
we know that the petitioner will also come back here for extension of the order.
thereafter, also, sometimes it does not reach.
on that particular day, it is on board, it does not reach and
the respondent seeks an adjournment, circulates a letter and gets an adjournment after.
there are various circumstances. alright. thank you.
i'm extremely grateful to your lordships. mr. pai.
we've got your note here. 501.1, my lord.
i respectfully adopt all that my learned seniors before me have said.
only one or two things that i may want to add.
the genesis of my matter is a classic example of the problems with asian resurfacing.
this is a criminal trial, these are advocates, my lord, who appear
for an accused, they have been roped in as conspirators with the accused.
yes. i secured a stay in the high court in 2014, matter doesn't come up.
the stay now stands vacated by the orders that
i've impugned before your lordships, only on the ground.
not on the ground that i'm seeking an adjournment, not on
the ground of anything else, not on the ground that the
stay deserves to be vacated for a, b or c reasons.
only the ground of asian resurfacing. only on the ground of asian resurfacing.
yes. so, my lord, most of it has already been said.
i'll just take a couple of minutes.
may i only point out, ultimately, judicial discretion is the essence of the adjudicatory process.
what asian resurfacing has done in effect, is completely, my
lord, taken away that discretion that the hon'ble high court
has exercised or is to exercise in respect of giving interim orders.
it's not that an interim order is not given without application of mind.
your lordships have already observed and others before me have already
argued that the aspect of application of mind is taken away.
what it also does, is dilutes the power of
the high court under section 482 as well as 226.
yes. finally, my lord, i'll just put it all in the note.
i don't want to waste your lordships' time.
the basis for asian resurfacing, if your lordships see paragraph 36
and 37, the basis for asian resurfacing is a judgment called imtiaz.
yes.
where, your lordships, my lord, have discussed the delays in trials, etc.
there is really no reasoning, why asian resurfacing paragraph 36 and 37.
my lord, the intent is very good.
the intent, of course is to avoid delays in trials and promote speedy trials.
there can be no doubt about it, but there is no specific.
as mr. dwivedi has already argued, never arose.
i'd like to end with what justice holmes
said, life of the law is experience, not logic.
asian resurfacing is probably logic, your lordships, my lord, five years of experience.
grateful, my lord. thank you, mr. pai.
my lord, mr. mehrotra is appearing online.
if he may be permitted to address?
anything else mr. mehrotra apart from what has been said?
please unmute yourself, you're not audible. mr. mehrotra, you're not audible.
you'll have to. you're still muted, actually, at your end.
yes, now you are unmuted. alright, you just set your house in order.
we'll hear mr. nazki in the meantime.
my lord, i appear in mr. pai's matter for the state of andhra pradesh.
and i completely support, mr. pai in that.
my lord, just one addition.
what your lordships have done, my lord, in the judgment, is that you
have also imposed fetters, my lord, on the very exercise of jurisdiction, and
i would only draw your lordships attention to a constitution bench judgment of 1964.
i have passed on the judgment. it is air 1964 sc 1573.
your lordship gajendragadkar speaking. what is the name of the judgment?
my lord, the name of the judgment is
b. rajagopala naidu vs state transport appellate tribunal.
my lord, here. what is the para?
what para would you be referring to?
my lord, para 19 would be relevant, my lord.
i'm only drawing a parallel where, my lord.
we now request all members of the bar to start citing scr.
scr is now up to date, up to the last few days.
there is an scr citation also. may i. and with neutral citations as well.
we would certainly do that, my lord.
and now that the allahabad high court bar association
is before us, e-scr has now 30,000 judgments in hindi.
all judgments of the supreme court since independence are being translated into hindi.
it's in a searchable format.
so, exactly the facility which you have available on
the english scr, you have in the hindi scr.
so, please spread the word and.
my lord, what is sought, my lord, to
be done in this judgment, is that by.
and this is being now extended to other
indian languages, brother oka is very actively monitoring that.
my lord, what was sought to be done, in
this judgment, is by way of a statute, my lord.
a fetter was sought to be imposed, on how the quasi-judicial authority would exercise jurisdiction.
my lord, that your lordships said is not permissible.
would your lordships have para 19 my lord?
may i. how does it begin?
my lord, may i just pass on the hard copy?
no, we have it here, right in front of us.
you have it on your screen as well, all the lawyers.
you'll have it on your screen. 'in reaching the conclusion'.
yes, we got it. that's the one, my lord.
'in reaching the conclusion, we have been influenced by certain other
considerations which are both relevant and material.' now the relevant part.
'in interpreting section 43(a), we think it would be legitimate to assume that the
legislature intended to respect the basic and elementary postulate of rule of law that
is, that in exercising their authority and in discharging quasi-judicial function, tribunals constituted under
the act must be left absolutely free to deal with the matter according to
their best judgment. it is of essence. it is of the essence of fair
and objective administration of law, that decision of the judge or the tribunal must
be absolutely unfettered by the extraneous guidance by the executive or administrative wing of
the state. if the exercise of the discretion conferred on the quasi-judicial tribunal, is
controlled by such direction that forges fetters on the exercise of quasi-judicial authority and
the presence of such fetters would make the exercise of such authority completely inconsistent
with the well accepted notion of judicial process. my lords, so. yes. all right.
thank you. my lord, just drawing a parallel. anything else? my
lord, mr. mehrotra, i don't know if he'll be able to.
mr. mehrotra? is someone appearing in person?
if your lordships can allow me to place.
yes, mr. mehrotra. the problem still persists mr. mehrotra.
if you've filed your written submission, we'll read them.
if you have filed your written submission, we'll read those.
alright. anybody else? we're all done?
i just wanted to add one judgment, my lord, mithu vs punjab.
your lordship will recall, my lord, taking away of judicial discretion.
on the death penalty? yes, death penalty, my lord. grateful.
