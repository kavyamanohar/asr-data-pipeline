carry away minerals other than the said minerals.
yes. so, the lease is for a specific mineral.
though, the state is entitled to enter upon the land for exploiting any other mineral.
yes. provided you cause damage to his right then you have to pay compensation.
yes. now, there is a form of the application in which the lessee, my lord,
had moved the application, which is also prescribed, that is form i, probably at page
one hundred fourteen.
form i, second page (vi).
he has to specify.the mineral or minerals which the applicant intends to mine.
my lord, justice pardiwala has got this form?
which page?
my lord form i. form i, clause three (vi).
what page was that?
on one hundred and fourteen my lord, one hundred and sixteen maybe.
minerals are minerals for which the applicant.
yes. if you see part vi, provisions relating to 'rents and royalties'.
clause one says, that rent and royalties to be free from deduction, but clause two
is very important.
for the purpose of computing the said royalties, the lessee, lessee shall keep a correct
account, now what follows is important,.of the minerals produced and dispatched.
the account as well as the weight of the mineral, minerals in stock or in
the process of exports may be checked by an officer.
so therefore, the liability to pay royalty. so, that time he has to pay.
it's payable.
the liability to pay royalty arises, when the decoupling has taken place.
yes. namely that the mineral has been extracted and at the point of removal.
yes. so that's the point of decoupling, not at the time of grant of lease,
at the time the land is as such.
we transfer the land also to occupy.
unless we transfer the land, the lessee cannot do the mining.
the mining rights will be useless.
so that, mineral rights and the lease of land go together.
and the lessee has to specify in the application, what minerals he wants to mine,
the period, the extent, the details of the area.
so, he's making a conscious choice.
and even with respect to period, the law says minimum twenty, maximum thirty.
so, there is a range of twenty to thirty, between which, my lord, the applicant
and the state government will have exercised that discretion and a bargain will be there
to fix the period.
exact period, could be twenty five in between.
so, it's not that contract is absent, my lord, in the case of state. now
what, next?
mister dwivedi, what justice pardiwala had just now mentioned about giving up, page one hundred
and thirty seven.
yes, my lord. now, don't look at it so seriously, but when a miner goes
down in order to extract the minerals for which he has already paid something and
he finds a placard there, “queen isabela is already here’ or‘was already here’ and he
says, i give up the rights for.
yes, that's right.
so, that was the first point which i was making, my lord that under the
act, rules, forms. the alienation or segregation, separation or decoupling of minerals from land happens
upon exercise of the mineral rights post grant of lease.
again. take it again.
the alienation, segregation or separation, which is the more appropriate term or the decoupling of
mineral from land, happens under the nineteen fifty seven act, rules and lease form k,
only upon the exercise of mineral rights by the lessee and not at any prior
point of time.
thus, the law is consistent with the natural phenomena of the minerals taking birth and
acquiring shape in the womb of the earth.
and second my lord, the lease itself shows that one, this is a contract albeit
statutory.
but the essential elements of contract, namely the making of application with an undertaking to
comply with law, including payment of royalty. and the acceptance of the application by a
grant order under section four.
along with execution of lease, which states that it is an agreement would show that
the lessor and lessee have to agree to the terms.
right. more than this my lords, if the central government itself does the mining under
section seventeen (three), it will have to pay royalty, dead rent, surface rent, at the
same rate, at which is payable under section nine of the act. as if, the
words are, as if such, mining has been undertaken by private person.
this is a fiction created by central government, rather by the parliament itself that even
central government, if it does, is treated to be a private person.
but we are told that, it's a relic of past.
so, when form k is executed, is it a grant of a mineral right?
along with the land, the mineral rights are also granted.
but for the lease, section four says 'there will be no mining except under the
lease'.
so, the mineral rights are transferred.
they belong to the state, they are transferred.
i can do mining myself.
that the state can do it itself.
reserve it.
earlier, my lord, till introduction of seventeen (a), that is the tenth of february, nineteen
eighty seven.
the state government needed no approval of the central government. seventeen (a).
but after this, under seventeen (a) the state government, if it wants to reserve under
seventeen (a)(two), so now, we need approval of central government, but up to ' eighty
seven no approval was required.
we could say that we will do the mining under our own corporation, ourselves.
now section seventeen (three), when it says that central government will pay royalty as a
private person, it is acknowledging that the land and the mineral belongs to the state
and that is why, agrees to pay royalty. it is not agreeing to pay tax
to the state. it takes a lease in the same manner.
therefore, you pay the royalty in the same manner.
there are only two ways in which the state government can be deprived.
the first is, either the constitution itself provides that the land and mineral will vest
in the union, that is article two seventy nine.
that is regarding the 'economic shelf', there's 'economic zone'.
the numbers were reversed, my lord. two hundred and ninety seven.
that's one way.
the second way is, acquire the land by means of an acquisition act by law,
referring with respect to entry forty two, list iii. and in fact, if your lordship,
looks at article thirty one (a)(e), even private rights existing leases, the rights can be
extinguished by law.
which then will be protected, if it is under thirty one (a) protected from challenge
based on article fourteen etcetera.
notwithstanding anything contained in article thirteen, no law providing for e. in fact, a and
e can be read together.
the acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein, or extinguishment
or modification of any such rights.
and then e, extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by virtue of any agreement,
lease or license for the purpose of searching for or winning any mineral or mineral
oil or the premature termination or cancellation of any such agreement, lease or license.
a farm, a huge farm of one hundred acres.
one hundred acres.
and i come to know that in some part of my farm there are minerals.
i cannot start extracting those minerals on my own because minerals, not of my ownership.
still, there has to be a lease deed, right?
so, lease deed will be only with respect to extraction or removal of the minerals.
land belongs to me.
and if your lordships are having out the.
yourself, you want to do the mining yourself, then of course it will be relating
to permission to excavate.
royalty has to be paid because i am removing it, removing the minerals so that's
the notion my lord that minerals always belong to the sovereign and the state. can
you just read section seventeen (three) again, mr dwivedi?
section?
seventeen (three).
seventeen (three), yes.
where in exercise of the powers conferred by subsection one (a) or section two, the
central government or the state government, as the case may be, undertakes prospecting or mining
operations in any area in which the minerals vest in private person.
it shall be liable to pay prospecting fee royalty, surface rent or dead rent, as
the case may be from time to time at the same rate at which it
would have been payable under this act.
if such prospecting or mining operations had been undertaken by a private person.
this is seventeen a (three).
your lordship wants me to read, seventeen (three)?
seventeen (three).
wherein exercise of powers conferred by subsection two, the central government undertakes reconnaissance, prospecting or
mining operations in any area, the central government shall be liable to pay reconnaissance permit
fee or prospecting fee, royalty, surface rent or dead rent, as the case may be,
at the same rate at which it would have been payable under this act.
if such reconnaissance, prospecting or mining operations had been undertaken by a private person under
a mineral concession.
now until the actual extraction takes place or removal, as this statute uses the word,
is it possible, of course, that the right to the surface of the land vests
in one person, and the rights to the mineral vests in another person.
that's also possible?
it depends on the terms of the lease my lord, what is being.
no, even before, forget the fact that there is a lease, can there be a
situation where the surface rights vests in a and the right to minerals vests in
somebody else?
for instance, service rights vests in the private person and the right to minerals vests
in the state?
no, it will go with the land.
they are the right of the landowner.
so, unless by law or by contract a notional separation is brought about in the
two my lord it won't happen.
yes. before i leave this, your lordship may just have one more clause of form
k which is the last clause nine, of part ix, page one hundred forty one.
begins at one hundred and thirty seven.
you are saying part ix, right?
part ix. clause nine.
the last clause.
clause nine.
for the purpose of stamp duty.
the anticipated royalty from the demised land is so and so per year.
sorry, for the interjection, my lord. chief justice's question.
kindly look at section twenty four a (two).
twenty four?
twenty four a (two).
you might get an answer.
this is the question which from my lord justice pardiwala, with a surface, right of
somebody.
mineral right with somebody else.
twenty four a has nothing to do with that one.
section twenty four a doesn't answer that.
well, because if the law contemplates a situation where the title to the surface vests
in a and the right to mineral vests in b. then, does the law then
not provide for an artificial decoupling even prior to removal.
it's not my submission that by constitutional amendment or by parliamentary law since the power
of regulation is with them under entry fifty four.
whereas to see to what extent they want to provide.
so, there will be some stray cases, if at all my lord, where because of
joint family or something.
they divide amongst themselves that some part goes there, some part goes to somebody else
which is very unlikely situation and perhaps my lord, may not be very helpful in
answering the controversy, which is your lordships, are considering.
and so far as twenty four a is concerned, it's only a case where a
private person's land if somebody is.
same as twenty four a that holder of lease will pay to the owner of
surface.
these will apply only where a private person is having a land which is having
mineral and then some third person wants to do the mining on that then lease
is granted by state government under section four, but surface right, therefore surface rent is
to be paid to private person.
that's all it's saying.
just come forth.
do you want to add this one sentence without affecting mister dwivedi's, because we have
almost come.
this was considered by the supreme court in the tarkeshwar, i was mentioning at that
time.
considering the halsbury's laws of england, specifically saying that both can be held the place.
but normally the presumption is that, everything up to the centre of the earth, including
mines and minerals, vest in a person who is the owner of the surface.
but there should be a legislation.
to take away the mineral.
that's what mr dwivedi also said.
this is a fundamental.
that.
the judgment is.
yes. please give us a citation.
it is tarkeshwar. i will cite that judgment.
you're citing.
then, it's okay.
mister dwivedi is going to cite it.
mister dwivedi, don't forget this, when you are.
yes. so, your lordships have seen that stamp duty. yes, we saw that.
it's a different entry, but royalty is the measure.
i will elaborate on this aspect when i again come back to the constitution, the
submission would be that the mineral value is not the sole preserve of entry fifty
list ii. stamp duty, the law itself contemplates royalty as a measure.
and if your lordships will look at entry fifty four list ii sales tax as
it existed before gst, before the one hundred first constitutional amendment twenty sixteen.
it was sale of tax on sale of goods.
so, mineral would have fallen there and states have been recovering under sales tax act,
and it's the sale price.
so, the entire mineral value is a measure in sales tax also.
yeah. if it's a declared goods, minerals is declared goods, then central government will fix
a certain rate.
ceiling will be there.
that's the limitation.
constitution has given enough indication the framers as to what is limitation and i had
referred to eighty six (three) also in that connection.
that was section fifteen of the central sales tax act. i'm grateful.
it's not blocked by a prolix and expansive search all over the places like searching
a needle in the haystack my lord and then come out that this is tax
occupied field.
so occupied field has nothing to do with this.
the central the parliament does not occupy the field of taxation.
it's a limited concept.
as my lord, said justice nagarathna my lord that you can extract everything from twenty
three but there also, to the extent.
yes, it's not subsilentio.
parliament by law, provide extent.
not state government, not by rules, not by forms.
so, the four percent will come from section fifteen, but mineral value, the sale price
of the mineral value will be its basis.
and not only state tax, my lords, parliamentary tax also.
excise duty if they want to levy on the production of minerals, which they are
levying, it will be based on the mineral value.
if you want to import, impose export duty under customs duty, again, it will be
based on mineral value.
so, there's no such thing my lord that other tax entries cannot be at all
have a measure which is connected with mineral value.
it's not the sole preserve of entry fifty list ii. my lord that mineral value,
the measure based on mineral value is not the sole preserve of entry fifty list
ii. measure based.
measure based on?
mineral value or a portion of mineral value.
how else a capacity of land can be salvaged; a capacity of land should be.
how do we determine the capacity of land?
same extent of land of same nature lying in noida will have one value, coming
back to delhi my lord its location, its use, what the master plan is permitting,
the moment you turn a lease land, a residential land into a commercial land the
same land value will go up.
so, the capacity of land depends on what it can produce, where is it located,
what is the permissible use.
here the permissible use is mining for the mineral which is lying in the belly
of the earth.
so, stamp duty erstwhile as the sales tax stood and even today oil, still there.
under fifty four, a sales tax is still being levied on oil, crude oil, and
also on variations, gas.
and it is based on sale price of those items.
and similarly in the central act, that is excise duty, customs duty, tax on capital
assets, all of them will be based on this.
so merely because you find that we have imposed a tax on land based on
mineral value or half of mineral value, my lords this also must be decided my
lord, assuming i'm wrong in this and your lordships doesn't agree, that mineral value as
a whole can be used.
why can't my lord a part of it be used, let's say as orissa has
done, percentage of half of the mineral value.
so, land's worth has to be determined in some way.
why can't we say twenty five percent of the mineral value?
and if it is still disrupting some national policy or something my lord, there can
be a dialogue, after all states have voluntarily united to create a union.
article one says india that is bharat is a union of states. so, union and
states have to gel together, they can't afford to all the time, despite the politics
which is conflicting and introduces an element of conflict, but cooperation is also there, has
to be there.
so, if there is some such situation arising my lord, that government of india feels
that their whole economy will go bust and there will be disaster, et cetera my
lord, i don't think any state, possibly my lord will be saying no to reduction
of tax or to grant a holiday of tax.
what are we witnessing around?
should we close our eyes my lord to what the states are doing towards the
industrialists.
red carpet my lords. they can walk into the chambers of the government my lord
anytime.
it's the common man who can't walk.
the chapprasi will stop him my lord, 'appointment hai ke nahi?
but they can, just a phone call and they will be escorted into the interior
chambers.
my lord i'm not casting a, that's the capitalist phenomena which is all over the
globe.
not here alone.
so, they can always walk there my lords. in fact, these companies are themselves competent
to my lord pressurize the government to reduce the taxes.
we can't do it.
anyway, parliament has the power to impose limitations.
yes, that's on one tax.
one may same my lord that all right, you can get out of this and
then go into forty nine.
go into stamp duty.
this argument of three hundred percent, five hundred percent at one point of time in
nineteen nineties, the figures have been given by the learned solicitor general that three hundred,
five hundred, because the royalties, et cetera, were very low and therefore they needed revenue
and therefore.
but today, no state is a revenue.
the affidavit is silent on one very vital aspect post kesoram at least in west
bengal for the last twenty years this tax is being levied.
what disaster has happened.
should not the government of india tell your lordship, that this west bengal tax has
caused what impact.
has it burnt the economy?
has it prevented any obstacles for export import?
in any case if state tax is high royalty can be anytime reduced by the
government. yes embargo is on increasing the royalty that can be done only once in
three years.
reducing it it can be reduced anytime.
government of india has more than one power to tackle a situation of disaster.
so let this not be a subterfuge to bang the states. state of west bengal
is levying tax on mineral rights as upheld in kesoram for twenty years.
what is the proportion of that tax to the total.
how is it impacting that's the real test, we say the proof of putting is
in the eating.
here is a tax, which is being levied for twenty years.
why don't you analyse that and tell the court to what disaster is happening.
are we to hallucinate some disaster just the moment the state touches r's. one per.
jharkhand says one and a half rupee per square meter for land.
no mineral value and is lying stayed here, struck down by the high court based
on these series of cases based on para thirty four.
what is nothing to do with mineral value.
what disaster would have happened?
the employees have not been paid their salary for four years.
the tax is not a return it's not a consideration itself a compulsion.
that's not a complete analysis, compulsion penalty or this.
it's a recovery of amount to be spent by the state for its own needs
and for welfare activities, not to give you back something.
but the structures, the construct of mr salve's submission was reduced, avoid the word tax,
use exaction.
so, it's an exaction for return.
look at the essence of entry fifty.
it is also an exaction for return.
so, bring it on the same plane and then it's a limitation.
that's how we read down one tax on mineral rights as becoming something which is
a return for mineral rights. compensatory tax the losses after great effort have been able
to avoid compensatory tax in entry tax matter.
at least four constitution benches and one seven judge bench your lordships overruled and everybody
agreed it can't be compensatory tax because compensatory tax means it's a fee.
there are exceptions to that.
yeah. so having knockdown compensatory tax in context of part thirteen.
now we introduce compensatory tax entry fifty itself.
so, unless it becomes compensatory, it can't be equated.
it cannot be a limitation.
these are the strange methods by which we alter the innate character of royalty. please
see one more article in the constitution. this two ninety four and the purpose of
showing this is that my right to land and mineral lying underneath in its belly
is not a gift of mines and mineral regulation and development act. the parliamentary act
can regulate it but unless it acquires all. two ninety four. two ninety four.
all the provinces, state provinces under all property and assets which, immediately before such commencement,
were vested in his majesty for the purpose of the government or of the dominion
of india and all property and assets which immediately before such commencement, were vested.
in his majesty for the purpose of government of each governor's province shall vest respectively
in the union and corresponding state, only the continental shelf was taken out.
so, the erstwhile ownership transferred to province we continue to be the owner of the
land and mineral and whatever is subsequently acquired by the states under land reforms act,
under the abolition of kingships.
my lords, kindly have volume one (c).
volume one (c), volume one (c) which is a rejoinder submission.
volume one (c) i think you have covered the, four of your submissions.
yes. at page seven.
your lordships have that?
my lord the chief justice?
yes. my lords at the bottom i have done nothing but repeated what your lordships,
sutras, as mister singhvi said, kindly come to page eight.
i have also mentioned entry thirteen, where more than one sutras are involved.
page eight, which?
para four.
if your lordship looks at entry twenty three and twenty seven and sixty seven of
list i. entry twenty seven of list i, right?
or at list two, sorry.
twenty three of list i. highways declared by or under law.
please mark this.
i'm drawing a distinction between entries which say, by law, by parliament, by law, or
those which say by or under law.
that will create a structural problem with respect to section nine being understood as a
tax.
which entry were you saying?
list i. twenty three, highways declared by or under law made by parliament and then
twenty seven odds declared by or under law made by parliament or existing law to
be major ports including the delimitation and constitution and powers of port authorities.
and then sixty seven.
ancient and historical monuments and records in archaeological sites and remains declared by or under
law made by parliament. perhaps your lordships will notice a box there.
declared, earlier it was declared by law but by constitution seventh amendment act, nineteen fifty
six, it was altered.
at the foot of that book your lordships should see that earlier.
now entry twelve of list ii. libraries, museums and other similar institutions controlled or financed
by the state. ancient and historical monuments and records other than those declared by or
under law made by parliament, is reflection of that amendment is here also.
and then entry forty of list iii. archaeological sites and remains other than those declared
by or under law made by parliament to be of national importance.
now compare this with entry fifty four, fifty two, fifty three and fifty four of
list i. regulation and development of oil fields and mineral oil resources, petroleum and petroleum
products industries.
the control of which the union is declared by parliament by law.
parliament has to do this exercise by its law, and it cannot empower a delegate
to make the requisite declaration or to lay down the extent.
that could be by a notification, if it is under law.
because one legislature is dealing with another legislature.
the central legislature vis-a-vis with the state legislature. so central legislature has to do it.
it can't say that i'm delegating this power to the government or some other authority
or officer of the government to lay down limitations.
now fifty three also, in the field, in the area of oil fields and mineral
oil declared by parliament by law to be dangerously inflammable.
so, no government or officer can say, i will declare it, or i will declare
in part and leave it rest to the government to declare.
fifty four also mines and minerals to the extent to which such regulation, development under
control of union is declared by parliament by law.
parliament also cannot say that well, i have made the law section two, is there
now rest will be laid down by rules, as was earlier done in nineteen forty
eight act. it did nothing but said rules will be made.
that was constituent assembly. but now that the constitution is in force, it has to
be done by parliament, by law, so by law, you have to provide the extent,
if you want to alter, reduce or increase a tax or a limitation or a
different kind of limitation has to be by law, but my learned friends have been
taking your lordships to the rules, the forms, and all those stipulation, because it is
general principle is, that delegated exercise is considered to be.
sixty two, sixty three, sixty four.
yes. there are other entries also.
fifty six is also there.
under law.
even article. entry fifty six.
yes, entry fifty six.
i'm grateful.
fifty six also. sixty three. sixty four. sixty four.
no, but this doesn't mean that everything has to be specified by the law.
the extent of the control by union has to be declared by the law.
once the extent of the control is specified in the matter of parliament, then, of
course, the rule making power can supplement it.
integrities and minor details may come by rules and forms. right. i'm not saying that
the form must come in the act itself.
declaration cannot be by a declaration.
declaration can't be and the extent of declaration.
right. parliament, your lordships, have ruled in case, that if parliament cannot say that section
two, i have brought in, now rest is to be done by government. so what
minerals you are.
the important aspects of the declaration, because you are extracting from twenty three.
you are depriving the state legislature of its competence.
that's the crucial thing.
and that's why it says to the extent, and even where entry fifty two did
not use the word to the extent, in ishwari khetan's judgment your lordship's constitution bench
has said that we will read in that word.
some meaning has to be given to the word 'extent of' because you are extracting,
depriving, denuding.
it can't be sub silentio.
some nitty details can come in, the form can be prescribed.
many other things can be done.
how you will recover royalty, how you will recover surface rent, all that can be
done by rules.
but under entry fifty two, the control of the entire industry which is declared is
with the parliament. parliament. unlike fifty four.
it is.
fifty four is only to the extent to which it is declared.
my lords right.
but in ishwari khetan's, your lordship, said that even those words are missing in fifty
two.
so, they read it down.
but we will read it.
that condition?
yes, if required, i can show that, in ishwari khetan, i'll show.
for the moment, this distinction, which i am pointing out has relevance to understanding the
limit of limitation in entry fifty.
entry fifty list ii says any limitation imposed by parliament, by law, not by or
under law.
also, the extent to which is only in the context of regulation of minds and
mineral development.
your lordships is right.
the words are missing.
the words are missing in fifty two.
my lords are right, absolutely right.
not but in ishwari khetan, if i may give, this judgment is in volume. so,
really speaking, entry fifty of list ii makes it that the limitation has to be
by law of parliament. yes. second that law is again to the contained of law
is qualified by saying it has to be a law relating to regulation and development
of.
yes. so, the major aspects, the major policy aspects of the law must come by
the law, they can't leave that to delegates.
that is paragraph eleven of ishwari khetan which is in volume five (a) and the
citation is nineteen eighty, volume four, scc one hundred and thirty six; nineteen eighty, volume
four, scc one hundred and thirty six.
paragraph is devoted.
so, one thing is equally clear that you have to also possibly concede, miss bhatti
yesterday made just one sentence, but it is a very succinct sentence which she used,
that the power of the state in regard to taxation is eclipsed not by a
taxing legislation of the union, but by a regulatory legislation of the union.
that's right.
no difficulty my lords. with this statement i have no quarrel my lord, but i
have a quarrel with the use of the word 'eclipse'.
it is subjective and therefore.
normally eclipse word my lord, a doctrine of eclipse that was deployed by lordships under
when existing law under three hundred and seventy two my lord is found to be
violated.
you have to apply that, article thirteen.
so, it was valid when made.
was it still gone or was it only under a cloud and the cloud lifted.
and once again, if you go to the nature my lord an eclipse happens when
something covers, the lunar eclipse or the solar eclipse my lord, some other object comes
in between.
the law mmrd act cannot come in between, cannot extract, cannot usurp, cannot arrogate.
the relationship of fifty four list i to twenty three list one is of one
character and the relationship of entry fifty four and entry fifty, list ii, is of
another character.
can you just wait for us, hold your thought there, just for a moment.
could you please repeat it?
yes, my lord. the relationship between entry fifty four, list i and entry twenty three
list i, entry twenty three of list ii is of one character, namely, you can
abstract, denude it as much as you want, as much as parliament wants.
and the relationship between entry fifty four list i and entry fifty list ii is
of another kind and character, which does not permit abstraction, only limitation.
my lord justice nagarathna has noted this ishwari khetan citation.
yes. para eleven.
hypothetically my lords, assume my lord that instead of the same expression was there in
entry twenty three as in entry fifty instead of subject to, subject to limitation, would
it remain identical, or would it bring about a substantial change in the nature of
the relationship?
in that case, then even the regulation will always be exercised by the state.
so therefore, when the learned additional solicitor general states that entry fifty four list i
being a regulatory power can limit.
i have no quarrel.
limitations can be imposed but if it is said when she says that this eclipses,
then there is a problem.
stricto sensu the doctrine of eclipse has propounded is for a different purpose where either
the competence is lacking or some other constitutional provision is being violated by an existing
law, then, but let's forget that technicality and go by the literal expression.
even then, something should come in between.
the only thing that can come in between is a limitation.
so, the power of limitation has its limits.
so please discover the limit of limitation.
it's not unlimited.
otherwise, the easiest thing was to accept shri brajeshwar prasad's request to transfer entry fifty
list to list i. the easiest thing, if you can eclipse, then take it.
i have already placed that.
every debate which happens on constitution necessarily goes across the seas.
the ship sail to the house of commons debate was read out to your lordship.
it's no different mr percy can be substituted by mister prasad. what he was wanting.
mister prasad was wanting and on both occasions that was not accepted.
that's the key important thing.
in a debate, in an assembly where constitutions are being framed, speakers says so many
things.
ultimately what is being accepted and rejected is the important thing.
so, both in the house of commons and here although they were paramount sovereign could
do anything.
brajeshwar prasad part.
can you just tell me which volume?
volume four a page sixteen starts at page ten.
mister dwivedi your junior is a walking encyclopaedia.
we have noticed this in repeated constitution benches. the last time we allowed her to
make that submission in the constitution bench today also, we are going to hear her
after you have concluded for five minutes.
she is well armed today, my lords. she's probably anticipated what's coming.
volume four a?
volume four a, page seven to sixteen, your lordships, and the relevant is at page
sixty.
with regard to entry fifty and with regard to entry fifty four is at page
ten and twelve.
just come again, please tell us?
volume four a and the debate starts at page seven your lordships. so far as
entry fifty four is concerned page ten and twelve and entry fifty is page sixteen.
yes. another way of saying occupied field, nothing else.
the principle of occupied field is completely unrelated to the relationship between fifty four and
fifty, can't occupy the field.
occupy the field.
just to probe you a little bit on this.
what kind of limitations would entry fifty contemplate?
would these be limitations contained in the law relating to mines and mineral development, of
an express nature, on the taxing power?
or could it be something more than just the.
that's one way of reading it, that you read the word 'limitations' in a very
narrow sense, because you are carving out of the.
competence. competence of the states. that's one approach, but does it have to be an
express limitation on the taxing power itself under entry fifty?
so, one my lord relying, if i have to rely on a judgment, then nine
judges judgment in jindal, your lordship, said it has to be expressed.
all constitutional limitations must be expressly stated, either in the constitution or the law, that's
one.
second my lord the framers of the constitution have.
in what context?
i think both.
nv ramana. in our judgment, we referred to that, i think.
yes. judgment of the chief justice thakur. also, my lords, that was in the context
of three hundred and four (b) which requires that if it is reasonable restriction, then
you have to refer to the president for ascent, so the contention was that if
every tax law is to be placed before the president, it being violative of three
hundred one, then all fiscal federalism is gone.
so, my lord, the chief justice, my lord, you handled the issue in a slightly
different way.
your lordship said that under three hundred and one, all taxes are not impediments.
so, the people who are challenging but they must produce enough material to show that
it is an impedimental free flow of trade, whereas the chief justice thakur said that
it can't be a restriction.
that was a divergence.
but at the end of the day, unanimously the taxing power was disentangled from the
grip of three and four (b), so that the states are free now.
that's, in fact a very important aspect.
thats para twenty eight of chief justice thakur's judgment. that's twenty seventeen twelve scc, page
one, it's in volume v, at page twenty nine thirty seven.
the discussion begins at page twenty eight under the caption, 'constitutional limitations must be expressed'
at three thousand and seventy four.
volume v, right? three thousand and seventy four.
may i please read?
just a second.
the power to levy taxes.
just only one second.
the power to levy taxes, being a sovereign power controlled only by constitution, any limitation
on that power must be expressed.
that proposition is well settled by the decisions of this court in umeg singh and
others versus state of bombay and from bansidhar ramsuk das versus state of rajasthan in
umeg singh case, this court stated the legal position in the following words, 'the legislative
competence of the state legislatures can only be circumscribed by express prohibitions contained in the
constitution itself, and unless and until there is any provision in the constitution expressly prohibiting
legislation, on the subject, either absolutely or conditionally.
there is no fetter or limitation on the plenary powers, which the state legislature enjoys
to legislate on the topics enumerated in the list ii and list iii of the
schedule of the constitution. the fetter or limitation upon the legislative power of the state,
which had plenary powers of legislation within ambit of legislative heads specified in list ii
and iii of the seven schedule to the constitution could only be imposed by the
constitution itself and not by any obligation'.
here one can substitute parliament under entry fifty.
and not by any obligation which had been undertaken by either the dominion or the
province of bombay or even the state of bombay. under article two forty six, state
legislature was invested with the power to legislate on topics enumerated in list ii and
iii of the constitution, and this power was by virtue of article two forty five
(one) subject to the provisions of constitution. the constitution itself laid down the fetter's limitations
on this power.
for example, in three hundred and three - two hundred and eighty six (two), but
unless and until the court came to the conclusion that the constitution itself had expressly
prohibited legislation on the subject either absolutely or conditionally, the power of the state legislature
to enact legislation within its legislative competence was plenary.
once the topic of legislation was comprised within any of the entries in the list
ii and iii of seventh schedule to the constitution, the fetter or limitation on legislative
power had to be found within the constitution itself.
and if there was no such fetter or limitation to be found, the state legislature
had full competence to enact the impugned act no matter whether such enactment was contrary
to the guarantee given or obligation undertaken by the dominion.
again, in bansidhar, this court reiterated the legal position.
it is well established that parliament or the state legislatures are competent to enact law
altering the terms and conditions of previous contract or of a grant which, under the
liability of government of india or of the state government arises.
the legislative competence of parliament or state legislature can only be self-circumscribed by express prohibition
contained in the constitution itself.
and unless and until there is any provision in the constitution expressly prohibiting legislation on
the subject, either absolutely or conditionally, there is no fetter or limitation on the plenary
powers which the legislature is endowed for legislating on the topics enumerated in the relevant
lists.
i think that's good enough.
yes. so, this goes on.
i'm not reading my lords. no. then it goes on to part thirteen.
yes. justice bhanumathi is.
paragraph, my lord. judgment paragraph is para two hundred and eighty one and justice ramanna
is para one hundred and eighty five.
but the only difference will be that under entry fifty, parliament can impose limitation, but
must do so expressly.
my lord, what is there i don't understand my lord, what is the hesitation?
parliament knows its policies.
industrial policy, mines and mineral policy, everything.
they know the export, import, the need of fdi and so on and so many
things.
but what prevents them my lord from having one provision and saying that.
just look at two hundred and seventy six.
article two hundred and seventy six.
i've already referred to article two hundred and eighty six (three).
two hundred and seventy six is yet another provision where framers have indicated how they
understand this limitation.
taxes on profession, straits, colleagues and employments, notwithstanding anything in article two hundred and forty
six, no law of legislature of state relating to taxes for the benefit of the
state or of a municipality, district board, local board or local authority therein in respect
of profession, state colleges or employment shall be invalid on the ground that it relates
to tax on income.
the total amount payable in respect of any one person to the state or one
municipality, district board, local board or authority in the state by way of taxes so
and so shall not exceed r's. twenty five hundred per annum.
so, the framers where they found that the measures are overlapping and they wanted to
protect it instead of eliminating it, they allowed it and said, here is the limit.
so, there is ample indication in two hundred and seventy six and two hundred and
eighty six (three) read with the central sales tax act. so why should not the
parliament analyse everything?
look at the operation of west bengal. by affidavits we can't create my lord a
doomsday.
all state legislatures are responsible, three hundred percent five hundred percent.
my lord, what prevents the parliament, supposing the pi five say the parliament imposes five
hundred percent, three hundred percent, that is after.
it can be said vice versa to that also.
but we don't say that.
we assume that they will act with constitutional responsibility.
at one time in india, we had a ninety seven, ninety seven percent tax on
income coupled with the wealth tax.
in fact, the real rate of taxation went up to one hundred and three percent.
one hundred and three percent.
so sometimes the taxes are also imposed to control the exports.
we don't want a mineral to be exported, we'll say one hundred percent.
so, nobody will export and sell here, so there are.
but parliament knows all these things.
the finance ministry knows, the commerce ministry knows.
they can all deliberate and say that here is this.
don't impose it more than this.
don't impose on royalty. mohit mineral case, your lordships, my lord, the chief justice has
mohit mineral, your lordships have talked about fiscal federation federalism.
yes. what is the citation of mohit mineral?
twenty twenty two ten scc page seven hundred.
at which para?
para fifty, fifty two.
in fact, it begins at paragraph forty seven to fifty eight, where your lordship held
that state governments are not bound by the recommendation of the counsel, it's only recommendatory.
and this principle was up to para fifty nine.
mister dwivedi, you have incorporated it in your written submissions?
yes, i have.
you may just read that paragraph.
we have five minutes to go before we close for lunch.
para ten.
para ten, is it?
para ten.
which volume?
one (c).
one (c).
your lordship on the judgment, from the written note?
from your written note, one (c) you have quoted paragraph fifty six.
and one hundred and seventy one. one point two. page eleven of your notes?
yes. para ten.
recently this hon’ble court in union of india versus m/s mohit minerals while holding that
fiscal federalism is one of the important features of indian federalism, held that the recommendations
of gst counsel cannot be held to be binding on the legislature.
to regard them as binding addicts, would disrupt physical fiscal federalism, where both union and
state are given equal power to legislate on gst. one of the important features of
indian federalism is fiscal federalism.
a reading of the statement of objects and reasons of the twenty fourteen amendment bill,
the parliamentary reports in speeches in indicate that article two forty six (a)and two seventy
nine (a) were introduced with the objective of enhancing cooperative federalism and harmony between the
states and the centre. however, the centre has a one third vote share in the
gst council. this, coupled with the absence of the repugnancy provision in article two forty
six (a) indicates that recommendations of the gst council cannot be binding.
such an interpretation would be contrary to the objective of introducing the gst regime and
would also dislodge the fine balance on which indian federalism rest.
therefore, the argument that if the recommendations of gst council are not binding, then the
entire structure of gst would crumble, does not hold water.
such a reading of the provisions of the constitution diminishes the role of gst council
as a constitutional body form to arrive at decisions by collaboration in contestation of ideas.
neither does article two hundred and seventy nine (a) begin with a non obstante clause,
nor does article two hundred and forty six (a) state that it is subject to
the provisions of article two seventy nine (a).
parliament and state legislature possesses simultaneous power to legislate on gst. article two hundred and
forty six (a) does not envisage a repugnancy provision to resolve the inconsistency between the
central and the state laws on gst. the recommendations of the gst counsel are the
product of a collaborative dialogue involving the union and the states. they are recommendatory in
nature.
to regard them as binding addicts would disrupt fiscal federalism, where both the union states
are conferred equal power to legislate on gst. it is not imperative that one of
the federal unit, units must always possess a higher share in the power for federal
units to make decisions.
indian federalism is a dialogue between cooperative and uncooperative federalism, where the federal units are
at liberty to use different means of persuasion, ranging from collaboration to contestation.
so, although the context is the gst in parallel power, but ultimately my lord, the
whole trend of this court's journey with regard to federalism begins with kesavananda where your
lordship recognize it is a basic feature.
bommai. then bommai and then itc versus agriculture. four cases where lordships have held that,
where there is lack of clarity, ambiguity, et cetera, then tilt in favour of protecting
the state's niggardly power rather than by interpretation, by some legal subterfuge, dilute it, reduce
it, or obliterate it, that's the principle.
and not only there we are witnessing today my lord the conflicts between the state.
howsoever we may avoid this, the conflict where the governors holding the files, your lordship
said you cannot, orders were passed for premature release, governor was not signing.
then in periyapalayam's case, the lordship said that no, you have no authority in that
regard.
in so many spheres article three hundred and fifty six itself your lordship strictly construed
the earlier laws were all overruled and a new law was laid down.
so, the whole journey of this court is to protect the state and the surest
will, way of killing the states, the federalism is to squeeze and strangulate the fiscal
power.
my lord, my learned friend is finishing now.
there are a number of new points he has made because, frankly you opened, we
really opened the case, he has answered.
there are a number of points he has made on decoupling.
i'm not finishing.
just hold on.
oh, you're continuing after lunch.
i'm so sorry.
i thought you were finishing at one pm.
alternate benches.
discharge. we'll discharge the alternate benches.
i'm sorry.
my mistake.
i was told you're finishing at one.
my lords, your lordships may give me five minutes on federalism my lord. well said
in principle.
my lord there are some important points my learned friend has made, including on mmdr.
all right.
you can give us a small note.
i don't think it's for you, mister dwivedi, it's for the court to decide.
may i suggest my lord after he finishes give us half an hour.
don't be so stern, i'm just on a lighter vein.
all right, we'll come back.
give us thirty minutes my lord at the end.
yes. if i may quickly show some more aspects of the mmrd act. yes, there
are four situations.
one where state government grants a lease to a private person or to a government
company. and person will include juristic entity.
the second situation is where the central government reserves land that's seventeen (three), section seventeen
(three).
the third situation envisaged is, where both either central or state government decides to undertake
mining in a private person’s land that is seventeen a (three).
either central government or the state government undertakes.
.undertakes mining or prospecting, et cetera in a private person’s land.
and the fourth situation howsoever rare it may be, envisaged in chapter vi of the
minor mineral concession rules, nineteen sixty that is where the minerals are vest in partly
in the government and partly in private persons.
now, these distinctions are significant for respondent to mister salve's argument that in the case
of private persons it's a contract, in the case of state government it is purely
statutory, no contract.
i've already answered that there is a contract there.
but see, chapter vi of the mc rules, where partly, minerals vest partly in government
and partly in private persons.
rule fifty three at page seventy six.
'provisions of chapter iii and iv shall apply in relation to grant of prospecting license
and mining leases in respect of minor.
in respect of minerals, which vest partly in government and partly in'.
chapter iii and iv, all include, up to rule forty (g), that is rule thirty
one and form k. so, completely at par.
but, once royalty, dead rent, et cetera, is obtained, then it's divided as per share.
yes. so, there's no difference between a state granting lease and where this situation, the
fourth situation is existing.
and even in the situation where, private party completely.
where the minerals vest only in the private person, that is chapter v, rule forty
five.
that will be the fifth thing.
chapter v, which, according to me, was the third situation.
the chapter v heading shows that 'minerals vest in a person other than the government'.
now, rule forty five provides for the condition of mining lease here also, except that
there is a certain relaxation.
'every mining lease shall be subject to the following conditions.
the provisions of clauses (b) to (l) and (p) to (u) of sub-rule one of
rule twenty seven apply to such leases with modification, that in clauses (c) and (d)
for the word 'state government' the word 'lessor' shall be substituted.
mining operations shall be undertaken in accordance with mining plan'.
so, all those things are required here also.
they can't.
there also, you can't avoid the mining plan.
now the only thing is that there can be some other ancillary conditions imposed by
agreement in that.
but, the main thrust of the conditions in rule twenty seven are applicable here also.
yes. and sub-rule (iv) says - 'if the lessee makes any default in payment of
royalty as required, by section nine '.
so, section nine is straight away applied here.
and rule forty nine prohibits premium.
so, the range of restrictions, conditions, et cetera.
are here also statutory, except for a slight relaxation.
in essence, it's also a statutory contract. yes. and all these four situations, the royalty
source is section nine.
source of dead rent is nine a. and importantly, section fifteen allows the state to
fix the royalty for minor minerals.
yes. so, one of the submissions from the respondent was that -'if it is a
case of section fifteen, then it will be consideration.
but if it is this, it will not be'.
so, one and the same concept, derived from one in the same source section nine
or.
section nine will not apply to minor minerals.
not to minor minerals.
my lords are right.
it doesn't apply.
but the nature of royalty is identical.
only determination of royalty is left to the state government. yes. authority is different.
so, the characters will not differ from situation to situation.
it was also said that nine (b) and (c), mister singhvi said that all of
them are tax.
some others said, mister singhvi said nine (c) is not tax.
it's a fee, he said.
nine (b) is tax.
nine (b) and (c) and c my lords there is the hardly any difference.
in fact, in both of them involved a quid pro quo quite apart from the
fact that a royalty does not come to the state government. in one case it
goes to dmf, other case to nmet. and both have specific purpose.
in one case it is exploration, and the other case it is rectification of the
damage caused to the area affected by mining, or the people.
so, yes, this is one extra source for enabling relief to the people who have
suffered there.
but ultimately both of them are portion of a royalty and put in a separate
fund for a specific purpose.
so, whether we did not enter into a controversy whether it is in the nature,
essentially a fee or, but even tax can be sometimes put in a separate fund
for a specific purpose.
so, irrespective of this, it's a separate quantum.
it's nothing to do with something coming to the state government. so, this can't be
a limitation to entry fifty, list ii. you can't club nine, nine (a), nine (b),
nine (c), and all of them, bundle them together and say that these constitute a
limitation, impliedly.
now, one other submission of mister salve was - apply the principle.
now, the other principle invoked was generalia specialibus non derogant.
entry fifty is special entry.
forty nine is general.
therefore entry fifty will not be, so nobody says what is.
the argument was that since the constitution has bifurcated between taxes on land and taxes
on mineral rights, taxes on mineral rights cannot be subsumed in taxes on land and
buildings.
but nobody has, we have not argued that it is subsumed there.
there are two different aspects.
one is what we contend is, as i said earlier also that the measure based
on mineral value is not the sole preserve of fifty.
right. as long as the minerals have a direct proximate nexus with any other, for
example sales tax is based on it, but it is a sale tax. it has
to be per necessity based on a sale price.
excise duty. it has to be based on the point of sale.
and even bombay tyres, which they relied, actually helps us when it says that excise
duty can even include the cost of packaging.
they say, it doesn't matter as long as the excise duty is tax on manufacture,
you can have a suitable modification and you can contour your measures accordingly and add
something here and there.
so, that's not our contention that tax on land is a tax on mineral rights.
what they want to assert actually is, that we are actually using a constitutional subterfuge
or trying to a colourable exercise of power.
as in the guise of taxing land and buildings.
we are doing that.
mineral rights.
that's right.
so as to be liberated from the limitations which were imposed on you.
this kind of a contention has been repeatedly raised and rejected by this court that
if in case in the context of income, rr engineering was a case where the
haisiyat tax, the circumstances tax based on income.
yes. your lordships said that one is in sixty two others, list ii and other
will be in the tax on capital asset is an aggregate.
so as long as individually the tax is right.
for the incidents should be falling on the field which is contemplated.
if the tax is on land and the measure is not remote, not far removed,
it is valid.
so, in order to sustain the respondent's submission your lordships will have to hold then
that the measure based on mineral value is the sole preserve.
then obviously other entries cannot.
then obviously even sales tax cannot use it.
stamp duty cannot be levied on that.
but every day the registrations of transfer of property is being done on the based
on the value of the property.
and this is important aspect because what happens is that sometimes this court will be
limiting itself to saying that this particular measure is not available, struck down and we
stop there.
some other measure is adopted.
then again there is a challenge.
so, the state must know clearly, what are the measures which are available for imposing
a tax on land?
how should it be imposed?
cess and royalty is struck down.
so, if we say, all right, this is a tax relatable to half of the
mineral value.
so where should we stop?
should we say a quarter, after all mineral value emerging from the land has some
direct relation with it and some basis.
it can be made a basis.
some as part of it can be made a basis.
now, since orissa is not going for the whole of the mineral value is saying
that x not more than twenty percent of half of the mineral value.
can we do that?
now, they say leave it to the smaller benches to decide.
so once again matter rebounds back.
we can't take the full mineral value.
we can't take the half mineral value.
we can't take the quarter mineral value.
so where do we stop?
how do we determine the capacity of the land?
but one thing is very clear, the tax on mineral rights does not include mineral
bearing land.
in fact, some of the learned counsels on the other side said even minerals are
out.
it is only mineral right.
even here you can't take the mineral value.
you just take the document of lease like stamp duty but they forget that stamp
duty here also takes the mineral value, the value of the land.
so therefore, the state must be clearly told, because who.
otherwise will be every time doing something, every time my lord there will be a
challenge.
that look, there's some connection with mineral land and mineral value.
and for the last twenty years, the states are not able to, other states apart
from bengal not able to collect.
this is lack of uniformity in fact.
one state is collecting and for twenty years neither the central government nor parliament has
written to the state of west bengal that you limit this tax to this.
that was the best test.
they could have told bengal that this is high, leading to disaster.
please limit it.
make it half.
make it twenty five percent.
these are all limitations which are permissible under entry fifty.
they can say limitation means that ensure that the tax or some factor that etr
rate or something which they have suggested it should not go beyond this.
just on a point of information.
since my learned friend mentioned west bengal, west bengal is deprived of the enhanced rate
of royalty that was allowed in nineteen ninety one, post amendment.
we don't want enhanced reality.
we want our reserve.
it's a question of competence, not the amount you are depriving or not depriving, assigning
or not assigning.
it's a question of federalism.
the state must exist and state must enjoy the plenary power.
if you want to limit, limit it.
if you can deny something, deny it.
even limitation is denying.
but this is significant, that non issuance of any directive, not including any provision with
respect to state of west bengal shows that the government is satisfied that the tax
which is being levied and collected for the last twenty years is appropriate and causing
no disaster.
twenty years is not a small period.
two decades.
so therefore, this principle of 'general and special', when does it apply?
when there's.
the special provision must traverse the same genus, the same field.
there is a general provision which covers a particular field.
then comes a narrower provision, which covers part of it.
then you exclude it from the general.
but if the two fields, if the two taxing events, the two taxing objects are
different, now, here is the contradiction in their article.
mister salve says, there's a neat division, no overlapping.
and this is what sundararamier also says.
whether we call it aspect theory, whether we call it neat division or whether we
use taxable event and taxable objects to delineate the distinction, once the division is neat,
then where is the question and where is the scope for applying this principle of
generalia specialibus non derogant.
they are two independent taxing fields with a different taxing objects or taxable events.
and as the other side concedes, there is no overlapping, neat division, different aspects.
so, there is no scope for application.
this will apply in cases, for example, i may just give an illustration, where your
lordships, in several cases have applied.
they have cited some cases, but they are traversing the same field, which is not
possible in tax entries.
kindly look at entry twenty four list ii. 'industries subject to the provisions of entry
seven and fifty two in list i'.
just below is 'gas and gas works'.
so, in the case of seven and fifty two, the moment a declaration is made
by parliament. by law.
.the entire subject is taken away.
those industries go out of the fold of entry twenty four.
because they are subject to the provisions of.
that's right.
now, the issue arose in this court whether twenty five will go.
calcutta gas company case, nineteen sixty two, volume v, page two hundred and nine.
'it was held that union by law under entry fifty two cannot extract the scope
of entry twenty five '.
this is a case of special being carved out from industries.
because one particular industry is separately mentioned.
so, the field is same.
twenty five is.
twenty four is industry, twenty five is and the relationship of entry twenty four, twenty
six, twenty seven, my lord, the chief justice has dealt with in that case of
rera of west bengal and followed tikaramji and all those cases.
so, the structure of the relationship, see, how the relationship of twenty four with fifty
two drastically differs from twenty three with fifty four.
because once the union declares under entry fifty two, industry goes to the list i.
but twenty six, twenty seven send the trade and commerce, production, supply, distribution of goods
to list thirty three, list iii. in mines and minerals both shift.
the mines, mineral both shift to list i. but in case of industries, industry goes
there, product supply, distribution, trade, commerce, all shift to thirty three.
my lords have noticed all this in rera case.
so, these structural differences demonstrate a different kind of interrelationship.
rera was a very interesting case, because there the west bengal legislature enacted an act
identical to rera. identical to rera in all.
there's no conflict as such, that one says x and the other says counter x.
so mister dwivedi appearing for the west bengal government, there is a conflict.
because we have done exactly what the centre has done.
so, where is the bar on us, a very interesting here.
no other case has raised that issue really.
this is the only case.
this is the only case which dealt with that.
and since all these entries had been dealt by, there was itc and all those
constitution benches, so i said, i will not defend that.
but this was a solitary argument left.
but very correctly held by your lordships, that these theories will not apply in case
of taxations because there is no overlap, they are distinct, either divided by taxable event
by taxable objects, division is neat.
i accept what mister salve says.
it's neat.
but if it is neat, then where is the question of extracting from here or
there?
we have just to see that particular entry and see is the tax actually in
that field and is the measure having a nexus.
what do you mean by.
you can address it in your own turn.
what do you mean by tax on mineral rights?
i mean, how do we sort of conceptualize what is meant by tax and mineral
rights?
it's a tax on the aggregate of mineral rights.
just like your lordship held in case of tax on capital assets.
on the aggregate of the assets.
aggregate of all the assets.
s c navan and then dhillon of course, yes. that is entry eighty. eighty six.
eighty six.
eighty six, i think.
taxes on the capital value of the assets.
exclusive one asset is excluded, agricultural land.
so, when it says tax on mineral rights, it's a bundle of rights which always
goes with the lease.
the land is given for working there, mining operations and the rights are you can
enter.
your lordship notice that rule and the clause in the lease itself which says you
can enter, you can drill, you can excavate, you can beneficiate, so all those things
which you are doing in the leased areas including the right to extract and sell,
that's the sum total of the right.
because simply extracting and not selling is hardly any right, then.
but when you tax royalty as a state, are you taxing mineral rights then?
so, royalty, nobody is taxing now.
right. all the laws of all the states, including the west bengal, which has been
upheld in kesoram, expressly excludes all taxes and royalty. that is because of india cement.
kesoram has not attempted to indirectly overrule.
it only said that, that related to cess on royalty, a particular.
taking a cue from that that we can't tax on royalty. all the states changed.
they took the mineral value minus excise duty, minus sale tax, minus this, minus royalty.
so, no state is taxing or having any component even of royalty. so, there is
no royalty in it, of royalty. although i personally feel that cess on royalty, striking
down was wrong because royalty is a return.
it's a kind of income for the state itself and the state was using it
as a measure.
but anyway, that is now, no state is doing.
no state is doing it.
that's not an issue.
and it's not our contention, it’s not arising.
the only issue referred to your lordship is kesoram departing from that by correcting that
error in para thirty four.
that is limited error.
so, it's a bundle of rights, the aggregate of rights which is granted by the
rule, that is what is the subject matter of tax, which is also connected with
the mineral value, because ultimately as an excise of mineral right, one of that right
is to extract and carry away.
one thing, correct that the taxes and royalty are not being levied.
out in chhattisgarh is five percent of the amount of royalty payable and that is
a state tax. number of states levied said is five percent of the amount of
royalty. that's a measure, five percent.
that's why i'm submitting that, actually i would say that if a measure includes royalty,
is rather better than having the whole mineral value at royalty. royalty will be some
percentage fixed by central government. so, it's my income with respect to the transfer of
mineral rights, that's what we have submitted.
now if that is taken as a value, the tax will always be lesser than
if you take the whole mineral value.
by striking down cess on royalty, the result has been that the states are searching
and groping where to, how to take the measure.
instead of the whole mineral value, you take the royalty, which is a portion fixed
by this union. in chhattisgarh, they should be happy that it is pegged on the
royalty, not the whole mineral value.
if you take the whole mineral value, it will certainly go up, not down and
that's why odissa has taken half and jharkhand has completely eliminated just per square meter.
so that to avoid all this controversy this is mineral value or not mineral values.
another aspect is the definition of 'land revenue' under one hundred and fifteen and one
hundred and sixteen of the tamil nadu act. yes. land revenue, it means so many
types of.
it says, like, for example, water supplies, irrigation on the land.
yes. these amount, other sum payable, royalty. royalty. so, royalty was included in land revenue.
and therefore, section.
the explanation included it.
therefore, under the tamil nadu act, it was struck down.
absolutely right.
i’m obliged.
your lordships is absolutely right.
if the word 'royalty' was not there in the explanation.
the controversy with regard to mmdr act at all.
explanation brought it in.
explanation included royalty. therefore, they expanded the arguments to say that -'it is encroaching under
the central act'.
i agree.
absolutely, that's right.
but what i am trying to place it for consideration is that, had it been
royalty, because royalty is a portion of the mineral value.
central government fixes under section nine and it can fix.
we are not questioning.
now that will be, let's say, ten percent of the mineral value.
so, as it is, we come down from one thousand to one hundred and one
hundred, then you impose some percentage of royalty. it's much less than paying ten percent.
of the whole value.
so, it's up to you, my lord. i would think that taking royalty as a
measure should be permissible that enables the union to then.
now, what else mister dwivedi?
now, just one more aspect is that, one argument was raised, that -'we are not
the owners of land, we are the occupier, so you can't'.
.
raised by mister salve is, noscitur a sociis, my lord. point for her to argue.
she has.
fine. mr dwivedi, just one point.
i've a very brief note.
this noscitur a sociis, my lord, how does it apply to this.
what is the argument is -'take entry forty five, forty nine, fifty neighbouring'.
as i have understood, the words should be associated in the same entry.
one is general one and the rest are.
you can't read taxing entries as if they form part of one fasciculus, as they
used to say in the seventy ' s.
so, this noscitur a sociis.
noscitur a sociis means that when words of a general nature are followed by words
of more specific nature.
the general nature of the words must take colour from the specific.
it should be in the same provision.
for example, in this luxury tax.
or as they say, birds is a feather flock together.
yes. that is another way of saying.
or 'the man is known by the company he keeps'.
may not be true because.
all really shades are the same principle noscitur a sociis.
don't let it flow much, so wide that the scheme breaks down.
these are independent taxing entries.
you can't restrict one by.
one by the other.
so, each has a different taxable event.
you say, no, take it from that.
since land revenue is collected from the owner, therefore, here also it can be levied
only on the owner.
but for the respondent's benefit, if your lordship has section four.
sorry, section three (i), at page thirty eight and thirty nine of the written submission
one (c).
i'm giving the cases on noscitur a sociis.
see (i), three (i).
'expression 'mine' and 'owner' have the meanings assigned to them in the occupational safety, health,
and working conditions code twenty twenty '.
this was amended by act sixteen of twenty one.
earlier, it said, as in mines act, nineteen fifty two and the owner, page thirty
eight of the written submission, at page twenty nine, i have quoted.
sorry, page twenty nine.
this is the definition of 'mine', and at page thirty, your lordships will find l,
'owner'.
'when used in relation to mine, means any person who is the immediate proprietor or
lessee or occupier of the mine, or of any part thereof and in the case
of the mine business, the business whereof is being carried on by liquidator or receiver,
such liquidator, but does not include a person who merely receives a royalty rent of
fine from mine or is merely the proprietor of the mine subject to any lease
granted'.
so, the lessee and the occupier are owner under the mmrd act. so, in any
ways, even if noscitur a sociis is applied and we treat it as falling on
the owners, the occupier and the lessee are owner.
for fifty years lease, which is now mandatory under eight (a), you are the lessee
and occupying and carrying on operations, and it's also a matter which your lordships' judicial
notice can be taken that everywhere, the lessees are paying property tax and all those
things.
in our house at allahabad, it's on lease from the union and property tax is
to be paid by the lessee.
in fact, in that us case, which a young lawyer, mister ghosh, had cited, the
supreme court said that they are two different rights.
the power to tax is to tax as a sovereign and power to enter into
a contract and grant lease, et cetera, as a contractual right.
so, the fact that you have given a lease and that you have not reserved
any right to tax is of no avail because tax is by virtue of being
a sovereign for sovereign needs.
there's an interesting passage in jindal with regard to abuse of power.
first of all, your lordships have consistently said that abuse of power is not a
ground to test the validity.
that will be tested separately.
para one hundred and twelve.
the court, very interestingly, has said that when you tax, you tax your own constituent.
because we states are wanting investors to come in.
they want the money to flow in.
they want business.
they want to give employment.
so, the constituents themselves create pressure.
i would submit that please take para one hundred and twelve of jindal combined with
rr engineering, chief justice yb chandrachud's observation that if you impose the tax so high,
then the measure will lose the.
and it will react on the levy and show that it's something else, which you
are doing.
the character is lost then.
if the two things are combined then that resolves the issue of largely and rest,
government of india has many powers to do.
if somebody, some state is hell bent a lot to destroy the union, its fiscal
policies deliberately, then three hundred and fifty six is there not to discharge it.
in three hundred and fifty five, they are bound to protect the federation. they can
issue that.
are you giving ideas?
they can acquire.
supposing for the critical atomic mineral, some state is acting in a particular manner, they
can acquire that land.
that's at page forty four.
anything else, now?
yes, just one thing.
it was said that.
in the same vein and context, it was said that resources are unevenly distributed again
and again it was harped upon.
and therefore, few states, handful of states having resources will blackmail or do whatever, sinister.
but the reality is the states which have these mineral resources are the poorest states
in the country.
i'm so grateful.
that's exactly what i wanted to submit that's chirag tale andhera jisko bolate hai.
the people are going from outside and exploiting the minerals.
that's right.
vedanta. who's complaining?
vedanta, tatas, adanis, ambanis. they are complaining that this is too high.
your lordships have detagged the assam case.
we had given the state there was quite active and helpful.
and so, they gave in statistics that's a company which is a government company is
earning ten thousand crores per annum is not willing to part with zero point five
eight percent of that.
in the last twenty years the amount of tax which they have to pay is
fifteen hundred crores and that profit is ten thousand crores per annum.
because of the delay, interest has risen to by three thousand crores.
but leaving that interest aside for the moment to judge the levy, fifteen hundred crores
in twenty years and ten thousand crores per annum in twenty years.
so, none of these are coming out with balance sheets to tell your lordships of
how much profit they are earning from this.
but they are trying to paint disaster, the doomsday.
as if all states are hell bent, they are something like indian states earlier, who
were collaborating with the british and trying to bring down the centre. they constitute india.
they are bharat. why will the states my lord. we have surrendered all the powers.
they were all representatives of state elected by states in the constitute assembly. and they
surrendered the power willingly because they felt that the country must unite.
so, the larger share was given to union and now, we are told that you
are acting something like that to destabilize and do what not.
so, this uneven distribution, actually is a boon, not a bane.
there would not have been trade and commerce in the world and in india if
this differential distribution is not there.
some state has got something to give.
another state has got something else to give and that's how we unite.
the economic unity is built on this differential distribution which is being decried.
and uniformity of price is yet another theme.
uniformity of price.
does price depend only upon royalty or upon this?
it will depend upon so many factors, supply and demand.
the price will go up and down.
these all-lease holders and sometime back in the previous decade, they were all mining iron
ore and sending to china. their religion is one.
as somebody said, my lord, that, in times when rome collapsed.
so, it was said, lord, that venetians continued to trade with the arabs also.
they used to go to jeddah and everywhere.
and they said the venetians had only one religion.
in that religion was prophet.
so, one side had prophet muhammad, the other side had prophet.
both side prophet.
so, they are worried whether their profits will go down.
and not concerned with this, as my lord said that - why is it?
the real question is, why is it not that the regions which have got so
rich in minerals, why are the people there poor even after seventy five years, is
the question to be asked.
of course, even the states.
we have to answer for that.
and your lordships have been pushing this dmf and all those things, and some penalties
which your lordships imposed.
then your lordships have asked a separate fund to be created.
justice ak patnaik has been appointed, my lord to see.
and then we have to bring a scheme.
we will spend it on these things.
hospitals, education institutions and houses and water supply.
so, he's monitoring.
so much is being done by the courts to push the states in.
so, i thought, my lord, if today somebody would have, the two governments would have
seen that these people, as justice krishna iyer said, the little man with little means.
where is he'?
he's still there, where he was.
so, this uneven distribution is, in my respectful submission, a boon.
it helps trade and commerce.
it helps mobility of people of one place going to the other place.
and these companies, unless they produce their balance sheets, et cetera, they should not be
heard to say that some disaster is offering at the doorstep.
what else, mister?
just one case, i want to cite, my lord, which is the last in the
occupied field that is 'monetized path,' where tulloch and all those cases, hingir-rampur were discussed.
tulloch, your lordships had seen, my lord, even with regard to entry twenty three and
fifty four relationship, since it is to the extent provided it extracts, how do the
court approach the issue, when a state act is challenged?
then the court will see what is the state act doing?
is that field covered by the mmrd act?
if the field is not covered, then this occupied field theory doesn't hit the state
act. that is what tulloch said.
but tulloch was dealing with the same license fee which hingir- rampur dealt with, and
therefore they said, that -'since the field is occupied, therefore you can't levy that fee
also'.
because all fee entries are relatable to the subject matter.
if the subject matter is gone, no fee.
kindly see page twenty eight thirty nine of volume v. kindly have paragraph one hundred
and thirty.
para one hundred and thirty.
kindly have from para one hundred and twenty nine.
their lordship also noticed the 'debate of house of commons'.
give us the pdf page once again.
twenty eight thirty nine, my lords. i don't think so.
it begins at twenty seven sixty.
i'm reading para one hundred and twenty nine, at page twenty eight thirty nine.
volume v. volume v. may i, please, my lord?
yes. yes. 'list i, entry thirty six federal legislative list and list ii entry twenty
three provincial list in schedule seven of the government of india act correspond to entry
one, list i, entry fifty four and list ii, entry twenty three of state list
in our constitution. it is interesting to note that in the course of debates in
respect of the above entries in the government of india bill, the solicitor general in
the house of commons stated that the rationale of including only the regulation of mines
and development of minerals and that too only to the extent it was considered expedient
in public interest by federal law was to ensure that the provinces were not completely
cut out from the law relating to mines and minerals.
and if there was inaction at the centre, then the provinces could make their own
laws.
but not imposing limitations, it is inaction.
thus, powers in relation to mines and minerals were accorded to both the centre and
the states. the same philosophy is reflected in our constitution. the management of the mineral
resources has been left with both the central government and the state governments in terms
of list i, entry fifty four, and list ii, entry twenty three.
in the scheme of our constitution, the state legislatures enjoy the power to enact legislation
on the topics of mines and minerals development.
the only fetter imposed on the state legislature under entry twenty three is by the
latter part of the said entry, which says, subject to the provisions of list i,
with respect to regulation and development under the control of the union. in other words,
the state legislature loses its jurisdiction to the extent to which the union government had
taken over control.
the regulation of mines and development of minerals has manifested by legislation incorporating the declaration
and no more.
if parliament, by its law, has declared that regulation of mines and development of minerals
should be in public interest under the control of union, which it did by making
declaration under section two to the extent of such legislation incorporating the declaration, the power
of legislature is excluded.
the requisite declaration has the effect of taking out regulation of mines and minerals from
list ii, entry twenty three to that extent.
it needs no elaboration that to the extent to which the central government had taken
under its control the regulation of mines and minerals development under nineteen fifty seven act,
the states had lost their legislative competence.
by the presence of the expression to the extent hereinafter provided in section two, the
union has assumed control to the extent provided in the ' fifty seven act. the
nineteen fifty seven act prescribes the extent of control and specifies it'.
so, this can't be by inferences and any other.
you have to specify the extent.
'we must bear in mind that as the declaration made in section two trenches upon
the state legislative power it has to be construed strictly.
any legislation by the state after such declaration trespassing the field occupied in the declaration
cannot constitutionally stand.
to find out what is left with the competence of the state legislature on the
declaration having been made in section two, one does not have to look outside the
provisions of the nineteen fifty seven act, but as observed in baijnath kedia have to
work it out from the terms of that act. in order that the declaration made
by parliament should be effective, the making of rules or enforcement of rules so made
is not decisive.
so, the rules, et cetera, are irrelevant.
the declaration made by parliament in section two of the nineteen fifty seven act states
that it is expedient in the public interest that the union should take under its
control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent provided in
the act itself.
legal regime relating to regulation of mines and development of minerals is thus guided by
the ' fifty seven act and the ' sixty rules. whether reservation made by '
sixty two and nineteen sixty nine notification is any manner contrary to or inconsistent with
' fifty seven act?
in my view, not at all'.
now, this was a case prior to seventeen (a)(three) being.
now approval is required of the central government. at that time, it was not.
whether the government of the erstwhile state of bihar did not have the power to
make reservation, which it did by ' sixty two and nineteen sixty nine notification.
i think there was no lack of power in the state in making such reservation.
i indicate the reasons therefore'.
then at the bottom one hundred and thirty three.
'no fundamental right nobody has'.
which we can leave.
then kindly see one hundred and thirty four. one hundred and thirty nine.
mister dwivedi. i'm reading one hundred and thirty nine.
your lordship will just note.
one hundred and thirty four onwards.
'the regulation of mines and development of minerals has been taken over and under its
control by the central government to the extent it is manifested in the nineteen fifty
seven act, which does not contemplate acquisition of mines and minerals by the presence of
keynote expression to the extent here and after provided is section two.
the union has assumed control to the extent specified in the provisions following section two.
in my view, though the word 'regulation' must in the context received wide interpretation but
the extent of control as specified in ' fifty seven act has to be construed
strictly.
the decision of the court in tulloch and bharat coking coal, baijnath kadia and few
other decisions where this court held that with reference to declaration made by parliament in
section two of the ' fifty seven act and the provisions of that act that
the whole of the legislative field was covered, were in the context of specific state
legislations under consider consideration.
in the context of subject state legislation, the whole legislative field was found to be
occupied by the central law. the same is the position in hingir rampur where whole
of the legislative field relating to minerals was found to be covered by the declaration'.
that's all.
the first five lines are.
yes. and they have dealt with all those.
what else now, mr dwivedi?
also note para one hundred and forty one, where they have to held that the
state governments are the owner of the land and minerals.
that's by virtue of the bihar act, they said.
yes. justice gokhale's judgment is conquering who all takes the same view.
so therefore, one has to see in each case the state act. mister singhvi's and
his response to that, he referred to five cases.
odissa cements and all those cases to show that those cases took the view after
india cement, following india cement and they said that the power to tax on mineral
rights would be located in entry fifty four list i read with entry ninety seven
list i. now my lords, these are all cases where the supreme court was following
the seven judges, judgment but they reveal that the court was struggling as in quarry
owners where i was arguing.
here also, to locate where is the power flowing from?
so, in one case they say that it emanates from fifty four list i, supported
by entry ninety seven.
in other cases, no, not ninety seven.
it's only fifty four list i. none of them will not consider sundararamier, et cetera,
because they were following india cement and it’s a tax, and therefore, actually, there was
no need to find out where it is located.
but. that was the position.
but there is one grave danger, my lord, when written submissions some paragraphs, or some
parts of the paragraphs are quoted.
there was a reference made to para forty of 'synthetics and chemicals', which is now
also under consideration in another bench.
now para forty is quoted.
now, 'synthetics and chemicals' had nothing to do with 'mines and minerals'.
it was dealing with.
the issue was whether indus.
the fee on industrial alcohol could be levied by the state of up or not.
so, they referred to entry fifty two, in ird act, that is something similar to
this mmrd act. industrial development regulation act, nineteen fifty one.
having referred to that, they said that the field is occupied by those act. right
or wrong, your lordships will see in the other matter.
but that was a case, which had nothing to do with mmrd act. and they.
para forty's six lines have been cited as if the court is holding, that this
entry fifty list is subsumed or can be.
the power could be exercised under entry fifty four, list i. that's absolutely unfair because
the next para says that it's not a mining case.
but what is an interpretation.
that's what the next para says.
let me point out your unfairness, please.
no, no, i am pointing out.
or i'll come later on.
you can comment on me.
i am pointing out that my learned friend should have pointed out to your lordships,
that these six lines do not constitute the paragraph.
they are not the finding of the court; they are submission of the counsel.
and he has presented it by extracting six lines and telling your lordship that -
'this is dealing with it'.
see para forty, my lords. page?
this is twelve oh two, volume v. this is unfairness.
but i am not attributing unfairness, because i don't engage in these things.
it may be an error and i'm not saying that the court was not cognizant.
what i am saying is that, you know that this case does not relate to.
and yet it is being relied upon for entry fifty.
so, sometimes my lord, in some other matters, some passing observations do come in.
please see paragraph forty.
it was submitted.
the whole paragraph is about submission.
my lords have got twelve oh two?
yes. 'it was submitted in the statement on behalf of union of india, that the
legislative competence of the state enactment in the various states will have to be determined
by reference to the following entries in list i of seventh schedule. entries, so and
so, so and so in list iii. it was urged that there is dichotomy between
eighty four, list i and fifty one, list ii. but this could not would not
control the interpretation.
there is no such dichotomy.
it has also been stated on behalf of union of india that while opium was
in entry, so and so it means that.
parliament will have power, but the power to levy excise duty in opium is given
to the state.
similarly medicinal and toilet preparations, which contain alcohol and are fit for human consumption.
the power of levy of excise is given.
entry eight of list ii, similarly is not subject to.
for the reason it was submitted'.
this is all submission of the union. and what my learned friend cited is from
the sentence -'the power to levy taxes is to be read from so and so'.
and then the court again said, according to the union of india, none of the
entries is so and so.
so, the whole paragraph is a submission.
and my learned friend has cited it and he's attributing unfairness to me.
i am not attributing, but my learned friend should withdraw the words.
it's more of para-e (twenty eight).
i don't want to engage in this.
e (twenty eight).
naturally, you have to run away from that.
my submissions are there.
it's very clear.
why should it have been included?
surely you would have seen.
you would have seen para forty something is a submission, not a finding.
our submission was of mister khambata, the learned counsel, about implied limitation drawing support from
justice sikri's observation in kesavananda bharati, that is paragraph eleven of his submission.
yes. the first aspect to be noted is that justice sikri's observation is in the
context of searching for limitations on the amendatory power under article three hundred sixty eight,
so as to prevent it from becoming absolute, but for this doctrine of basic structure
which was drawn partly from the fabric of the constitution and partly from the word
'amend', as justice khanna interpreted it, contextually.
so, this implied limitation theory is to curb absoluteness and draw a line beyond which
the amendatory power could not go.
but in the present case, it is sought to be utilized for the reverse purpose,
that is, to expand the scope of limitation.
so, while limited power, a power which is, a field which is already limited, it
is sought to be expanded so as to make it so absolute, that it destroys
and takes away the field from the fold of the state and places it in
the fold of the union. i have dealt with this in page.
paragraph sixteen of my submission, which is one (d), this is just a small note
to cover the yesterday's submission, so i had to.
the other submission was with regard to not drawing ninety seven, list i in article
two hundred and forty eight.
i cannot do better than rely upon my lord justice nagarathna's judgment, your lordships have
dealt with article two hundred and forty eight, state of karnataka. your lordships have said
that you have to only see whether the particular field is enumerated somewhere or not.
article two hundred and forty eight uses the word 'enumerated 'and ninety seven uses the
word 'mentioned'.
they are meaning the same thing.
so, we have just to see, once it is mentioned there, then there is no
question of ninety seven.
no question of article two hundred and forty eight.
the only thing is, power will always remain with the state, can only be limited.
whether you can go up to complete limit, prohibiting or making it zero or not.
as in kesoram, i would submit that your lordships can leave it to the parliament's
good sense to, in its wisdom and policies.
to decide if ever they want to impose limitation one and limitation has to be
qua each mineral for mineral development.
so, it can't be across the board.
for example, even minor mineral usage is limited.
the parliament therefore, the government will have to of the day which moves the bill
will have to apply its mind to which minerals should be allowed, to be taxed,
which should not be, in which case mineral right should be allowed to be taxed,
where not, how much.
but it can't be a broad brush.
it has to be a rational and reasonable exercise.
and two hundred and forty eight is completely out.
in this submission i have enclosed that judgment.
us judgment. we don't need to go.
your lordships have time again said, us laws are different but it was.
provisions were quite close but yet different.
i have demonstrated in paragraph eighteen and i have annexed that judgment also your lordships'
benefit.
paragraph eighteen of one (d).
yes. particularly pages one hundred and forty five to one hundred and forty seven are
more relevant.
is it time to thank you, mister dwivedi now?
thank you so much.
i'll close my lord. i should thank you, my lord, for giving me so much
time and extending it beyond the lunch period.
extremely grateful.
yes sansriti. mister dwivedi, please sit by her side.
so, if there is something you can always assist her.
your lordships have my not volume i(f).
thank you, mister dwivedi. thank you.
your lordships, i have briefly covered four points.
one (f).
this can be actually scanned and put.
we got it here.
now it is scanned for us.
yes. your lordship, so the argument is, although parliament does not have any power to
tax minerals or mineral rights, but mmdr act is exhaustive of all the fiscal exactions
and therefore state is denuded of its power.
so, my lords as the expression used is colourless and neutral exactions.
and, my lords, there is nothing colourless about the exactions in our constitution. they are
structurally different, historically different, and a constitutional significance is attached to each of them.
i will refer to para two of my written note.
'it is submitted that, there is nothing colourless about fiscal exactions in our constitution. they
are structurally distinct, historically and constitutionally distinct, meaning and significance have been attached to them,
and are never used interchangeably'.
para three, i can skip, your lordships, it is jindal steel. tax is a compulsory
exaction by the state, in the capacity of a sovereign, your lordships. when it is
imposing a tax, it is imposing a tax on its sovereign.
as owners constituent. and when royalty is being levied, my lords, that is being levied
in the capacity of the owner.
so even the relationship in which the state is imposing a tax, that is different,
that is, sovereign taxing is constituent. royalty, owner imposing a consideration fee for parting with
the mineral resources that it has.
sub-para of para four, your lordships. 'the constitution uses distinct expressions such as tax, duties,
cesses, surcharge, fees, license fees, or fees for services rendered'.
this can be found in article one hundred and ten, which deals with 'money bill'.
distinct words.
then royalty is used in schedule six, para nine, my lord, of the constitution. fines,
other pecuniary penalties, again used in article one hundred and ten.
so, how do we use it interchangeably, my lords?
there is no concept of uniform fiscal exaction in our constitution, my lords. 'each exaction
or imposition are imposed under a distinct power, and they are distinct and not used
interchangeably.
tax, duties, cess and surcharge form one class of exactions which is levied under article
two hundred and forty five, two hundred and forty six, read with the taxing entries.
fees is another class.
fees can either be regulatory or services rendered, which is levied under two hundred and
forty five, two hundred and forty six, read with general entries and entry ninety six
and sixty six.
now, royalty in the field of minerals, license fees for the grant of spectrum, levy
charge for parting with privilege and liquor trade is neither tax nor fees.
it is the price charged as owner of these resources, and in the latter case,
a price of parting with privilege.
constitutional bench in state of punjab versus devans modern breweries has held that levy charge
for parting with privilege is neither tax nor a fee.
and it is simply a levy for the act of granting permission for exercise of
power to part with privilege.
it is neither tax nor fee and will not attract article three hundred and one
and three hundred and four.
dead rent and surface rent are payable under mmdr act to the state and the
capacity of the owner and lessor of the land.
when the leases of a private land with royalty, dead rent and surface rent is
payable to the private person.
here also, payment is given to the private person, with the capacity of owner and
lessor.
these levies are not mutually exclusive.
state being the owner of the land can receive royalty for parting with the land
with mineral rights and can also levy a tax on the same land as the
capacity of the sovereign taxing its constituent.
the power of state to impose tax on mineral rights under entry fifty is a
power to impose tax.
none of the statutory fiscal exactions mentioned in section nine, nine (a), nine (b) and
nine (c) are or can be in the nature of tax.
parliament has provided for payment of royalty, dead rent, surface rent, et cetera, under article
two hundred and forty five, two hundred and forty six, read with entry fifty four,
which is not a taxing field.
to say that mmdr act, exhausts the field of fiscal exaction, distorts a settle distinction
between these impositions.
difference also arises on account of nature of relationship.
when taxes being levied, the sovereign is taxing its constituent'.
i can skip that.
para eight.
'it is neither tax, nor akin to tax, nor can it substitute a tax'.
then an argument was made regarding uniformity.
why is it so important that all the fiscal exactions are dealt with an mmdr
act?
all the subjects in list i, are those subjects which were sought to be held
to be having nation-wide implications and a uniformity was envisaged.
but the fact that those subjects, those subjects don't find mention in list ii. is
that each state.
justice bhanumati in a judgment in jindal my lords, she has discussed that disparity in
the state of development of the states all across.
each state has its own unique natural resources.
the nature differs, the quality differs, the state of development differs, the need differs.
so, to have a uniform fiscal policy for the entire country, this is destructive of
federalism, because the states should be in a position to devise their legislative mechanism to
deal with their individual needs.
so, there can't be straitjacket formula for list ii. that was never the intention.
those subjects would not have been put in list ii my lords. khazan chand's judgment,
paragraph two of this heading.
it says -'subjects regarding which uniformity was envisaged were put in list i and the
other subject'.
and therefore your lordships an article fourteen argument can never be made by comparing one
law of another state and some other state.
para four -'like there cannot be any taxation by inference, similarly, there cannot be any
limitation by inference on sovereign power of taxation.
firstly, limitations need to be expressed'.
jindal has been covered my lords. 'and secondly, even the express limitations need to be
construed strictly.
constitutionally, taxation by inference is a paradox'.
then your lordships, fiscal federalism.
'the jurisprudence regarding federalism, which is the basic feature of the constitution, is becoming more
nuanced'.
and your lordships, i have borrowed these expressions from your lordship's judgment in mohit minerals.
'there is collaborative federalism, competitive federalism, and federalism involving condescension.
the consultative and participative exercise of royalty fixation is an instance of collaborative federalism.
the states designing their fiscal measures by giving incentives, tax holidays, exemptions, lower tax rates
to attract investment or increased tax base is an instance of competitive federalism.
the states contesting for their power conferred under the constitution is a case of federalism
in contestation.
this aspect of federalism should not be seen as disruptive, but it is abundant duty
of the states to ensure that no limitations are imposed de hors the constitution in
the interest of uniformity national interest your lordships'.
article two hundred and forty nine deals with laws relating to national interest my lords.
that deals with a situation where there may be a subject in the state list,
but in the interest of national interest, there may be laws.
so, there's a procedure prescribed.
the resolution has a fixed life of six months.
so, national interest, then you go to article two hundred and forty nine if it
is permissible.
'there are express provisions in the constitution for situations requiring subordination of powers of the
state in national interest, and the procedure is also described in article two forty nine.
the states have plenary and exclusive powers over list ii subjects.
and that means they do not and should not have to knock on the doors
of the centre for imposing levies which they are exclusively empowered to charge.
knocking on the doors of the centre for tax relating to list ii subject is
not collaborative federalism, but subversion of federalism.
therefore, fiscal federalism is the most basic and fundamental aspect of federalism.
the existence of state depends on taxes, and they form the lifeline of the state,
without which states are rendered nothing but paper tigers.
‘your lordships, then the argument is limitation will include prohibition.
and this is based on those judgements your lordships. article nineteen (six) judgments.
haan. sorry your lordships. nineteen (six) and those general provisions which say that regulation will
include prohibition.
hind stone line of cases my lord. so, if your lordships just turn to entry
fifty first.
this says -'taxes on mineral rights, subject to any limitation imposed by parliament by law
relating to mineral development'.
my lords, my first submission is, 'regulation' word does not find presence here my lords.
the term is 'limitation'.
regulation, your lordships have found in entry fifty four.
but here the power is given to the parliament to impose limitation, not to regulate
power of the state.
you can regulate under entry fifty four.
you can make laws for mining.
you can prohibit mining of a certain mineral.
you can prohibit mining of a certain.
for a certain period, import.
that you can do under fifty four.
but here word regulation is not there, limitation is there.
so, to import those cases which say regulation will include prohibition that doesn't apply your
lordships. and your lordships, the term 'limitation' is used in one another provision of constitution,
which is article one hundred thirty four.
correct. just one second.
your lordship's limitation is found in another provision, which is article one hundred and thirty
four, which deals with appellate jurisdiction of this hon’ble court. i'll just read it out.
one hundred and thirty four (two), 'parliament may by law confer on the supreme court
and any further powers to entertain and hear appeals from any judgment, final order or
sentence in a criminal proceeding of a high court in the territory of india subject
to such conditions and limitations as may be specified in such law'.
when such restrictive words are being used in context of a court or of a
co-equal organ to say that limitation will include destruction.
yes. so, under the regulatory power of fifty four.
you can do whatever in the field of mining, but once you are imposing a
limitation, you are not regulating the power of taxation here.
you are imposing a limitation.
yes. so that is, and your lordships, mister dwivedi has already cited cases on entry
fifty seven but i just want to repeat.
entry fifty.
if your lordship sees entry fifty seven list ii. this is one other entry where
the taxing power of the state has been made subject to the parliamentary law.
this is under thirty five concurrent list. and thirty five refers the principles for the
formulation of rate.
context of entry fifty seven your lordships have held that - yes, they are allied
subjects, but they are distinct.
so, in assam judgment at page fifty three of the main written submission, one (a)
your lordships. the issue was the assam legislation had increased the rates of the taxes,
so that was challenged being contrary to the parliamentary law. the constitution bench held that
though the power is allied, one is power to tax, one is power to lay
down the principle for fixation of taxation.
so, yes, you can do it, but you can do it only under the general
power.
you can limit, you can also go to the extent of saying that five percent
or maybe for next five years you're not going to tax, but to say that
under this limitation you can regulate the power of state that is an incorrect submission
to with great respect.
my lords, i think that i have covered.
thank you, sansriti. thank you.
i think we had said that only one rejoinder otherwise there will be.
in the beginning, we took less than time what was allotted to us.
your lordship allotted two and one slash slash two days.
we concluded before two days.
both of us will conclude within the time which is remaining.
we are in rejoinder.
all right.
just two or three minutes.
the entire debate is list ii. now, lordship may kindly note, list ii has entries
from one to sixty six.
in effect, seven entries have been deleted.
there are fifty nine entries in list ii out of which thirty six entries are
without any restrictions.
just one second.
so now, out of sixty six, out of fifty nine entries today in list ii,
i have put that in my volume one (c).
page fifty two onwards.
out of fifty nine entries in list ii today, how many were deleted?
out of sixty six, seven were deleted.
seven have been omitted.
yes, by different amendments, including one hundred first amendment. thirty six entries are without limitations
whatsoever or restrictions, i'll not use the word limitation, restrictions whatsoever.
and twenty three entries have limitations of different degree.
or you would say restrictions of various degree.
restrictions of different degree which i have put in my written note in the chronological
order from category one to category ten in page fifty two and fifty three of
volume i(c).
where is it?
your written note as volume i(c), page?
page fifty two and fifty three.
if your lordship only see one entry.
i have put a name in chronological order.
yes. your lordships only see one entry thirty seven of list ii and my lord,
fifty of list ii. wide range of difference.
for example, thirty seven.
i have quoted them subsequently in fifty eight, fifty nine onwards.
i am summarized them at fifty two.
if your lordship see, page, entry thirty seven, which i've extracted at page fifty nine
of volume i(c).
'elections to the legislature of the state, subject to the provisions of any law, made
by the parliament'.
it's a very broad.
now, your lordships, contrast it with entry fifty of list ii. my lord, the argument
on the other side is -'once there is a laid provision of law made by
the parliament, entire entry is eclipsed or gone'.
these are of different degree.
the limitation itself has a limitation.
and those degrees my lord, i have put it in para.
page fifty two, para.
paragraph. two.
where have you put it, mister hansaria?
in the descending order, i have put it my lord. lordship had asked me, what
are the limitations?
which, i have tried to illustrate in paragraph four of page fifty three.
i'm sorry.
it's page fifty two.
my lord, the chief justice has got it, my lord?
yes. because, first category is, subject to any law made by the parliament, is widest
enough, my lord. second category is 'accept'.
that is in entry three and sixty five.
third category is not specified.
'subject to or other than'.
then, my lord, not including, other than, to the extent, subject to one and three,
then subject to one, then subject to three, and thereafter comes, my lord, 'subject to
the limitation imposed by the parliament'.
the argument is, this is the widest enough.
which is in fact, this is the least restrictions, my lords, the parliament has thought
it to impose or the constitution thought to prescribe.
secondly, lordships have been asking, what are the limitations?
which i have tried to give by way of illustrations in page fifty four a,
b, c and d, paragraph four.
'it can be extent or quantity of mineral that can be extracted, that is, by
way of regulation.
you can also say, on what basis the valuation should be done for the purpose
of taxation?
it can be price fixed by the indian good of mines.
it can be pit head price, it can be sale price, it can be tax
at the point of extraction of mineral, at the time, dispatch of mineral.
it can be a sealing'.
my lord. repeatedly asking five hundred percent.
we are not saying that parliament cannot do it, the limitation.
parliament can say - 'all right, it cannot be more than so and so percent
of so and so'.
so, it can put a sealing.
the period of exemption of a particular period or a particular area, or a particular
mineral.
these are the limitations and not the complete abridgement.
para five and six, my lord, my learned friend, mister dwivedi has gone.
taken to your lordship. now my lord, para seven is important.
if your lordships kindly come to page fifty five.
now, my lord, entry fifty four, before sixth amendment, was 'taxes on sale or purchase
of wood other than newspapers'.
it stopped there.
this subject to nineteen ninety two.
has come under the six amendment.
and before that, the sixth amendment, there was no power of the parliament to tax
on, sale or purchase of goods.
it was introduced only by the sixth amendment, and it was only controlled by article
two hundred and eighty six, which i have extracted at page fifty six, footnote.
'there were limitations on the power of the state, and by virtue of article two
hundred and eighty six, which were very specific, and precise, that's where, you cannot tax
outside.
you cannot tax import or import.
you cannot tax in the course of interested trade or commerce.
you cannot tax goods declared to be essential for the life of the community, which
were subsequently made of special importance'.
article two hundred and eighty six as adopted, provided in clause three of article two
hundred and eighty six, saying that - 'parliament can be.
cannot be.
no law for the imposition of taxes.
it will be declared by the parliament, to be essential for the life of the
community, which were subsequently made special important'.
that is, they were declared goods under the cst act. so, these are the limitations.
and not a power of enabling as we put it in the beginning.
this is limitation power and not an enabling power.
and finally, form k has been read to your lordship as a statute levying tax.
if your lordships see rule thirty one.
rule thirty one, which prescribed form k, it says as nearly as in form k
or in a form as near thereto as circumstances of each case may require.
so that is where the contract is my lord. if your lordships kindly see rule
thirty one, which is in volume iv. you have quoted it in.
page sixteen forty four.
you have quoted it at fifty seven.
i have quoted it my lord. fifty seven.
page fifty seven.
yes, my lord. page fifty seven i have quoted it.
rule thirteen my lord, form k is a modal form and it can be buried
with the statute itself.
and it says in form k or in a form, if it's a taxing, it
cannot be left to the parties of the bargain it.
so, that is where it has been left to the discretion of the parties, to
what extent they can modify.
and that has been read to your lordships as if it's a taxing power by
the centre. and finally, yes, the judgment my lord the chief justice said as is
given in para thirteen, that the form cannot control, justice chinnappa reddy's judgment, that is
(nineteen eighty six) one scc two sixty four at three hundred nineteen, para sixty nine,
which says surely form cannot control acts, rules or the direction.
it can definitely not control a constitutional entry, a sovereign power to tax by the
state. and finally, both the mineral companies and even the union of india has relied
upon the house of commons debate to interpret a constitutional entry of the thirteenth of
may nineteen thirty five.
what they were debating was one of the issues was whether indian subject of his
majesty should be there or british subject domicile in india is there.
those debates cannot be relied upon.
i'm so sorry.
if your lordships kindly see the debate.
one more objection.
final my lord. the affidavit of the union of india. if your lordships see para
twelve, i have quoted it.
page fifty seven.
they say, entries in the union of india affidavit i'm quoting of the twenty sixth
of february twenty twenty four -'entry of list ii, list ix cannot be absurdly wide
reading, and that the provisions of mmdr must be given wide and liberal construction'.
this cannot be the stand of the union of india on affidavit before your lordships'
court. i'm extremely grateful.
we are extremely grateful.
thanks mister hansaria. mister reddy?
my lord, before mister reddy begins, i just want to renew my request.
i see it's only twelve minutes to go.
my lord, there are some new points which have been made because actually we opened
the case and mister dwivedi. there was no new point made.
there was no new point made.
it's an explanation.
if i had time, i would have told your lordships what is the new point.
decoupling was a phrase you used.
so, mister dwivedi. my lord, i am sorry.
i did not have.
if my learned friend had opened, i would have replied.
i opened with decoupling.
he has given an answer to, which i have not had a point to say
where he's wrong.
that's what i meant.
if your lordship permits a note.
if we permit you, there'll be another round.
a surrejoinder by their side.
my lord, just a note.
please allow us to deal with what he has said.
i will not go back to my original.
that your lordships has already.
the two points which he made today, entry forty nine, entry fifty and land, and
he made some submissions on when the land is decoupled.
just a four-page note.
what you can do is, mister salve, you can file a note not exceeding three
pages.
just. yes, my lord, done.
yes, absolutely.
and not necessarily three pages my lord. can i also file a note?
only two to three pages on new points.
alright. especially entry forty nine.
my lords. that is what our concern is.
certainly mister solicitor. and my lords, we'll file it by end of friday. should we
be limiting the size of the note, or should we be regulating the size of
the note?
as long as you allow.
your lordship allows us to develop it.
but i suggest is that mister solicitor, mister salve, mister bagaria give us one note
of not more than three pages.
please put your heads down together and give us one note.
i think that would be better.
conceptually better we shall do that.
we will do that.
i just wanted to give a reference to the notifications where royalty was revised, excluding
the state of west bengal. just the note.
what is in the note?
we have pulled pen drive now.
two-page references only.
two thousand four revision is at page twenty one seventy, volume iv. two thousand seven
notification is at volume iv, page twenty one seventy a two thousand four notification is
at page one five three one two, volume iii. may i please your lordships?
i'm grateful.
volume i is my submission.
i don't propose to read it because i have very little time.
i'll just state three or four points that i've touched upon in my note, kindly
have volume i(e) for your lordships reading agenda.
what are the points?
the point is, first point that i touched upon in my submissions is that minerals
do not automatically vest in the state. that's a wrong concept.
the judgment of this honourable court in, thressiamma jacob that specifically refers to different lands
having different characters.
it notes that in different states there are different tenure right.
for instance, when surplus lands reverted to the state, states then grant what are called
as tenure rights.
ryotwari pattas in the south of india and some other terminology used in rest of
the country.
when ryotwari pattas are granted in respect of lands that revert to the state, there
state only grants cultivation rights.
so, subsoil rights remain with the state, surface rights remain with the cultivator.
this is one category of land.
rule seventy two in the morning, my learned friend mister ganguli showed your lordships, the
statute was cognizant.
that there could be one category of lands like this.
the statute was equally cognizant.
there could be private lands where the subsoil rights vest in the persons who own
the land.
like in thressiamma jacob's case, there was one category of landowners who were found to
have subsoiled rights.
but in the house of commons debate that is placed for your lordships, it notes
the position at the time government of india act was being made, that in bengal,
state of bengal while it was believed that under the british rule only the surface
rights were granted, for over one hundred years each of the landowners were exercising subsoil
rights without any complaint from the crown.
so therefore, those rights in that sense remain ceded.
so, my lord, that this concept that of all minerals vest in the state, therefore
the royalty exclusively goes to the state, is my respectful submission is a wrong argument.
so, that's one point i've touched upon giving some details.
i also said that from nineteen oh one, the mines act, followed by the successor
nineteen twenty three act, nineteen forty eight act, the rules, nineteen fifty seven act, consistently
throughout recognize this position that minerals do not automatically vest in the state. this is
very important because if minerals do not automatically vest in the state, and if the
royalty and dead rent becomes payable to the mineral owners, it is actually a consideration
for one-time finite resource.
the royalty, the expression, i have touched upon it in my submission.
it has been explained to say that, unlike land, where cultivation can go on, on
a recurring basis, my lord in respect of mineral it is a onetime finite source.
so, an owner of a land who has a subsoil rights.
it could be the government, it could be a private person, it could be a
limited right of a private person or the government having subsoil rights.
when they give out these mining lease, the lessee extracts the mineral out.
so, there's a one time complete exhaustion of a finite mineral resource.
therefore, there's a compensation that has to be paid to the landowner who loses that
mineral forever because it is a finite source.
so, royalty is therefore not an exaction, levied by law.
it is not a tax.
royalty is a consideration for the grant of right.
what nine does, in the regulatory sphere, and it is permissible is, it caps the
consideration that can be levied, by a person who owns the mineral.
but for nine, every person can quote his own right as to, what he would
ask for, for the purpose of giving a land on mining lease.
this may come in the way of the country's developments or regulation steps in, section
nine comes in, royalty is fixed.
dead rent is fixed.
my learned friend mister dwivedi showed to your lordships, there's a little leeway in respect
of private landowners.
dead rent is fixed as per schedule three.
royalty my lord may not be fixed in respect of private landowners, because that rule
forty five does not take into account that royalty fixation in inter se to private
owners.
so, if royalty is therefore, in my respectful submission, not an exaction.
it is actually a regulatory limitation of consideration that can be taken under a contract,
for granting mineral rights.
so, if it is limiting the consideration, a contractual consideration, it can never have the
sovereign character of tax.
and if it has.
if we try to be contended and it was, and i'm therefore making that submission
that it has every trapping of tax.
it can never go to a private person.
if it is going to a private person, and it is not going to the
state, state gets nothing in those categories of land and in those states where subsoil
rights may vest exclusively with private people all there.
so, there's absolutely no element of tax.
so, my lord, it is one point i touched upon.
only one.
quickly another point.
with regard to tax on land.
please see the situation when they say that -' five.
fifty completely eclipses forty nine '.
my lord, 'eclipses' i'm using the word literally.
not in the legal sense.
mister dwivedi was at pains to point out.
it cannot be.
because, land is a continuing exist.
it has a continuing existence.
land has been in existence throughout.
fifty comes in only and only when a mining lease is executed.
if there is no mining lease, executed, i may have mineral in my soil, but
i am carrying on cultivation.
my lord, i do not come under fifty.
state cannot tax me.
because it is land and i am cultivating the land.
i am subject to forty nine.
fifty comes in respect of one aspect of mineral rights.
my lord, please see the situation after the mining is complete.
mining cannot be forever.
it can go on for thirty years, fifty years, depending on the mineral-richness of the
soil.
after fifty years, land reverse to being land again.
it can be taxed again under entry forty nine.
so, pre-mineral lease forty nine, post-exhaustion of mineral or determination of lease forty nine applies.
so, forty nine cannot go into this hiatus for the limited period mining lease operates.
so, mining lease deals with a different aspect of mineral rights.
land remains land.
it's a permanent feature.
it continues to be land even when it is being mined.
it does not take it outside the taxation fore.
the government, in a given case, they're to abuse forty nine power to surreptitiously override
any limitations, that the parliament, by law may impose.
then the court would strike it down for being a colourable piece of legislation. so
therefore, i touched upon this aspect, that land and forty nine is something that cannot
be made subject to fifty, which is purely temporal and on a completely different aspect.
the last aspect that i touched upon, that house of commons debate that has been
placed by your lordships. that's a very interesting thing.
the joint parliamentary committee, when it made recommendations on government of india act, the recommendation
it made was - 'taxes on mineral rights should be given, my lord, to the
federal government'.
that went before the house of commons when they debated government of india act. post-debate,
post mister percy's concern, lord percy's concerns that were expressed, my lord, the british parliament
made the government of india act, which actually moved it.
it is an improvement on the constituent assembly debate.
it was not originally, my lord, in the provincial list.
notwithstanding these concerns, they wanted to give this power to the provinces.
because provinces must realize some revenue.
so contrary to the joint parliamentary committee recommendation.
my note, my lord, gives us entries in this.
it was moved to the provincial list. so, first is contention.
very importantly, the last of the submissions, i put it in my note.
a case arose from the country of canada on british north american act. there were
two entries.
my lord, the federal list had an entry saying that - 'it would deal with
incorporation of banks, trade and commerce'.
provincial list says that 'provinces can levy tax on entities for augmenting its resources.’ matter
went up before the privy council. contention was if provinces were to act excessively and
collect heavy taxes.
it would come in the way of regulation of trade and commerce by the federal
government. such power must not, therefore, be ceded to the provinces.
but i've placed that judgment.
that judgment which is not an identically worded terms, but on similar arguments that have
been advanced, that were rejected by the privy council, stating that when this act vested
this authority with the provinces and their governments, it did not suppose that these provisions
will be used injuriously, excessively, or arbitrarily.
it reposed faith in these provinces, to exercise their power judiciously.
i'm sorry.
so, therefore, that judgment may have some guiding factors for your lordships. i've placed it
also as a part of my submission.
but i'm deeply grateful, my lord. thank you.
arguments concluded.
judgment reserved.
