good morning, brother narasimha. are you online?
good morning, chief. brother narasimha is joining us online.
yes, yes, yes. good morning, chief. good morning.
i have sent that note, it's been shared,
placing on record the culmination of the consultative process.
i have also placed on record the proposed amendment.
since mukund came in the context, whether an endorsement would
be require or not, all these conclusions that the classification.
yes, mr. attorney general, i got your note.
yes. along with a note we have the letter.
there's a letter received from the ministry which is.
i have placed it on record. 15th april, which outlines in seriatim proposed amendment.
after i looked into it, i thought a few more.
but therefore, you'd like us to now hear the
matter at this stage or defer the matter for the.?
that's it. and the proposed amendments also, you have referred to.
only the letter from the ministry which contain the detailed
set of amendments and along with it the approved draft
language, but that's only for placing the matter before your lordship.
but a few more things that came to mind yesterday.
the amendments that are proposed is to categorize the transport and
the non-transport category within the bracket of lmv license, light motor vehicle.
in national insurance company, category of vehicle and type
of vehicle it said does not make a difference.
that's why the endorsement was not required there.
so, i thought we should take care of that question.
a few more things, i think.
we know that election is on, but you see, we have indicated
that we'd like to see the light of whatever the proposed amendment.
any timeline in your. only after the election.
the consultation process is almost over.
it has to go to the cabinet committee
and all that, then i think it'll be through.
and then after i got that, i had a few
more suggestions, i thought, i'll share it with the ministry.
for the purposes of this case, my lord, it may not make any difference
because, as your lordship had seen, if i'm right in, my lord, what i
had contended last time, that section 3 that proviso says that provided if you
want to drive a transport vehicle, your license
must specifically authorize you to do so .
therefore, the license should have had an endorsement, that your
lmv license, you are authorized to drive a transport vehicle also.
now my lord, they have made this only clearer, but they have not changed it.
they have not said that you don't need an endorsement.
but then on the other hand, once the amendment will
come, we will see what is the impact of this.
possibly. just have a. i looked into it.
i'm alive to that. just have a look at the proposed section 10.
just have a look at the proposed section 10, my lord.
that's on the second page of that proposed amendment.
yes. starts on the second page.
and if your lordship has 10(2), which is on the third page.
a learner's license. does your lordship have that?
yes.
a learner's license, or a driving license, as the case may be, shall also
be expressed as entitling the holder to drive a motor vehicle specified as transport
vehicle or non-transport vehicle with manual gear selection or automatic gear selection, as the
case may be of one or more of
the following classes, namely light motor vehicle, category 1.
so, what they've done is they've divided light motor
vehicle which was up to 7000 kilos, into two categories.
lmv-1 and lmv-2. that's right, but, they have also made it clearer than before.
earlier, my lord, when i had to look at three proviso
etc. now, they've made it very clear that your license will
indicate, whether it's to drive a transport vehicle or a non-transport vehicle.
so, therefore, the same position as was there earlier, they're only making it clearer.
so, therefore, in my humble submission need not wait.
in 10(1) every learner says so and so shall be in such form,
shall contain such information endorsed in such manner prescribed as so and so.
therefore, the rules will certainly take care of all of that.
what we'll do is let them, since they are now proposing to bring
about an amendment to the mv act, let them go ahead with this process.
and what we could do is we'll keep it.
because otherwise if we deliver a judgment before the amendment,
then what is the impact of the amendment on the
judgment of the constitution bench will again be a moot question.
so, instead of that, we can have the amendment.
see, what, if you are right that the amendment in
fact makes things the position which you are espousing clearer.
yes.
then we can always say that we can deal
with the amendment which has been brought about by parliament.
i have no difficulty with that my lord,
the only issue is how long they'll take.
because since your lordship had heard this matter substantially therefore, i'm not.
we'll take it in, say, the second week of july.
no. i think the sessions may be only after.
let it be in the last week of july.
little time to push through.
because i know what kind of agendas the parliament will have immediately.
many pending agendas are there. i won't be able to say anything now.
there is one more. attorney general, there's one more thing.
yes.
when parliament brings about the amendment, we'll also have to see
what happens to those people who held licenses in the past.
will you apply the sunset clause?
i've asked ministry to take care of that, so that we provide for a transition.
and that there's no gap in the, as far as the.
exactly. there has to be some provision for a transition.
there are certain things, my lords, we want to propose.
my lords, can we also be consulted?
because, while the consultations. they can all give.
you can give whatever you want to the ministry.
the consultation process is complete, but that you
can always give what you want to the ministry.
so. my lord, just one thing.
what fell from, my lord, during the hearing
was, my lord, won't be changing anything retrospectively.
because, my lord, appeals are pending. everyone has got compensation.
what will be done would be prospective.
even if the amendment comes, it will be prospective.
so there's no point keeping this present petition unless, my lord, is inclined to change
it from '91 and give an interpretation. let's keep it where it is right now.
whether it is prospective, retrospective. we needn't anticipate what parliament will do.
no, my lord.
even if they bring it, or change it,
doesn't change it, it will be all prospective.
we don't know. parliament has the power to do what it.
prospect to legislate retrospectively.
today, my lord, the question is, what transpired from '91 till now. my
lord, what fell from, my lord, would not give an interpretation which would
change things retrospectively. counsel, why are you insisting on that? i mean, elaborate
arguments, i think all the pros and cons have been discussed in course
of the deliberations. and the government is proposing to take a call by
virtue of the amendment. whether the amendment will apply
retrospectively. i'm sure they will have a this thing.
the chief justice has already indicated that there
will have to be a sunset clause as well.
so, therefore, i don't think the submission that
we are making has any bearing on the matter.
do you want us to write the judgement before the amendment?
it's an interim order. our interests are protected.
that will protect us, my lord. that's all.
in pursuant to the order dated 22 november 2023, the union ministry
of roads, transport and highways, has carried out an exercise of consultations.
the learned attorney general has submitted a note indicating that the consultations carried out
by the ministries, have culminated in certain proposals for amending the motor vehicles act, 1988.
by its communication dated 15 april 2024, the ministry has placed
on the record details of the proposed amendments to the statute.
in view of the pending general elections, the learned attorney general for india requests
that these proceedings may be deferred until the last week of july 2024, so
as to to enable the union government, to bring forth proposals for the amendment
of the motor vehicles act 1988 before the newly constituted parliament following the general elections.
the impact, if any, of the amendment which is proposed on
the reference will be decided in the course of the hearing.
in view of the above position, we stand over the hearing
of the reference to the constitution, then to 30th july 2024.
that will be. my lord, just one thing, my lord.
my lord, for the consultation we are allowed
to, because it will only make the process.
see, we don't have to say.
it's a parliamentary process, so we can't say that you shall be consulted.
they'll always do it. you submit your representation to morth.
and my lords, if it's important. they've already carried out extensive consultation.
if you are so interested, you should have made your representation.
anyway, we'll not say anything you can always.
the para 5 of the order of 22-11-2023, in this very matter, i'll just
read that order, my lord, where your lordship has given us the protection, my lord.
it says, during the pendency of this reference, the judgment of the
three judge bench, in mukund dewangan shall continue to hold the field.
that's all, my lord. so, we have said that, it's not until today.
that is already clarified in that order.
just one thing, my lord.
in the last order what your lordship had said was, it
is understood that in the event that the issue is not
resolved by that date by the union government the proceedings shall
be listed for concluding the remaining part of the hearing on 23rd april, 2024.
now, that they have virtually formalized the amendment.
no, no, i know, so, all i'm saying is would
your lordship only add this, because if they don't do
it by the next date because, my lord at some stage.
mr. attorney general if it doesn't.
if the government comes to the conclusion that
you don't want to bring an amendment then.
we'll then.
my lord, i think even prior to the said date of hearing, i will
be able to come back to the court and inform the court in advance.
the progress will certainly be intimated to the court.
alright. now, thank you. here also, i have shared a note with the court.
now, what do we do in this case?
because the committee has submitted it's report.
the government say that because of the impending elections,
we have not been able to take a final conclusion.
now, you have said that on a prima facie consideration of the report
and points of view that may be presented to the court in this
regard, this court may proceed to hear the matter or await the final
outcomes in the consultative process and the views of the government emanating therefrom.
so, what would you. should we list it then for hearing and then.?
yes, i think. please, either way. my lords, we would.
our request is your lordships should.
because the government has not accepted the report
and it's still being deliberated at the inter-ministerial level.
so, if this process goes on, it will go on for 6 months.
what we can do is we are now on the 16th of april.
we have basically one, two and three weeks, now.
how long will this matter take to argue?
my lord, the written submissions have come in from both sides.
i think mainly it is for the government and them to argue.
but on our side, i think there are
only two of us, so we will not take.
the issue will be my lords, really the four judgments of your lordships
in trf, perkins and tantia on one side and core on the other.
that's really the. there are other judgments also, my lord.
there are few judgments, also.
in fact, there are multiple facets which will have to be considered.
30th july? one more request, my lords.
i had moved an application for de tagging of my
petition, but we are withdrawing that application for de-tagging matters.
that's 1205. i have only spent some time whether to be de-tagged or not.
now they are withdrawing, i withdraw my time spent on them.
in view of the note which has been submitted by the learned
attorney general, it has been agreed on behalf of all the counsel
appearing on behalf of the contesting parties, that the proceedings may be
now listed for final hearing for the reference to the constitution bench.
the proceedings shall be listed on 30th.
we will keep it on the 30th itself.
it may go on for a second day, my lord.
for a second day. so 30th, 31st we'll wrap it up.
and my lords, i may be permitted to withdraw.
we'll finish it in two days.
i mean, i don't think this reference will take longer than that.
there are so many judgments now which hold the field from perkins onwards.
what is the mr. jethmalani?
one of the questions of law pertaining to perkins judgments, that
now all unilateral arbitration agreements stand struck down as per perkins.
that we will have to decide. we will hear everybody.
no difficulty. your lordships are permitting us to withdraw the application, my lords, 12052?
nodal counsel has still not filed the submissions as yet.
there are other things have kept coming in, my lord.
so, therefore even the dates i was going to make a request on the dates.
yes, the written submissions and compilations, in terms of the circular dated 03 april, 2024
shall be filed by the nodal counsel, no later than by the 15th of july.
yes.
all parties seeking to file any submissions shall ensure that they
are forwarded to the nodal counsel on or before 11th july, 2024.
so, you have four days.
then you have to just collate it and put it in a proper manner.
it's already mostly done. mostly done, we have already filed our.
mostly it's done. alright.
make sure that they are emailed to the court master so that.
yes, yes, your lordship.
