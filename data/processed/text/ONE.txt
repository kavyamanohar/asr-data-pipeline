volume two?
page one hundred and seventy three to one hundred and seventy nine and volume two-b,
twenty three to thirty.
but, i will confine myself largely to my one pager, which is in volume two-c,
the first page.
volume two-c will one page?
please, my lords. let's see what you have said.
my lords, just a prelude before i begin.
my lords, i've been privileged somehow, to work on citizenship issues and your lordships had
sent me to talk to people who had doubts about citizenship, to shaheen bagh. and
my request, my earnest request out here, is that your lordships are called upon today,
only to judge the validity of six a, the constitutional validity.
my lords, i'm taking a cue from what the solicitor general said, i am not
going to speak too much about what happens thereafter hereafter and all that, because my
lords, my experience has been, that any word with regard to citizenship, which is said
even slightly here and there, has consequences far beyond one state. we have made it
very clear we are dealing with the validity of section six a. now let's see
your one pager.
citizenship of india is the right to have all rights guaranteed under the indian constitution.
the provisions of part two of the constitution were framed by the constituent assembly only
for defining indian citizenship.
and the crucial words are, 'at the commencement of the constitution'.
this definition of citizenship was necessary, in order to define eligible voters to elect a
new parliament. that was the crucial thing, my lord. at that point of time, we
were a new nation, we were a nation that had suffered a partition.
there was a question as to who was an indian, and who was not an
indian. and therefore, the constitutional architecture of part two, was that we would define only
at the commencement, who is a citizen.
thereafter that last one, article eleven, left the field, open to parliament to do what
it thought fit in the circumstances.
the situation also had to take into account migrations due to partition.
the constituent assembly, therefore, limited their definition for the commencement and gave full power to
parliament to define citizenship, grant it or take it away.
the first parliament therefore, enacted the citizenship act nineteen fifty five, to regulate the citizenship.
my lords, just a couple of dates.
firstly, the date of nineteenth of july nineteen forty eight.
why was it chosen?
if your lordships were to go to volume four, page three hundred and fifty nine.
three thousand five hundred and ninety nine three thousand and fifty nine?
three thousand five hundred and ninety nine, volume four, doctor ambedkar's response.
instead of reading it, just tell us.
if you can just make the point.
the point simply is, doctor ambedkar said.
doctor ambedkar said in the constituent assembly. in the constituent assembly. doctor ambedkar said that
look, we have brought about an ordinance with effect from the nineteenth of july nineteen
forty eight, which would put in place a permit system. your lordships would recall from
the arguments prior, that those who had left india and gone across the border, they
needed a permit to come back for resettlement.
that resettlement date, after the nineteenth of july nineteen forty eight, they needed this permission.
and that permission was very difficult to get.
this however, applied largely to the western border.
on the eastern border, there is mister ayyangar, who at page three thousand six hundred
and seventy two, makes it very clear to the constituent assembly, that the permit system
was not to apply on the eastern border.
and for good reasons, that there was a substantial number of hindus who still remained
in what was erstwhile east pakistan, who may have wanted to come over, who had
not yet come over, and it was a continuing process.
among the hindus who later came over, was the first law minister of pakistan, jogendra
nath mandal. mister mandal, died in poverty, but he had several crucial interventions, and the
most important was that he got doctor ambedkar elected to the constituent assembly, from bengal.
and once that portion went over to east pakistan. doctor ambedkar had to be re-elected
from bombay, and that's how he came on to head the drafting committee. so my
lords, there was a fluidity in identification of indian citizenship.
while on the western border, it was reasonably clearly drawn, on the eastern border, it
was as a matter of constitutional history and drafting, kept deliberately fluid.
my lords, if i can now revert back to my note.
the second submission, my lords is that indian citizenship is not ethno nationalist.
it's not based on language, religion or culture, there is no superior or inferior citizenship
based on ancestry of any type.
this court should astute any statement that may ever unintentionally be judgmental of such claims,
especially in the emotive areas of india's northeast. for example, this very year a seemingly
innocuous statement in a tax case ended up in having consequences in sikkim. the learned
solicitor general did appear there and i just will pass on the order, my lords,
for your lordship's consideration.
your lordships will see that it was a very.
if your lordship sees page three, we think it just and proper and in the
interest of justice to correct certain phrases in paragraphs ten a and seventy seven of
the judgment by making the following correction.
the sentence, 'therefore, there was no difference made out between the original inhabitants of sikkim,
namely the bhutia lepchas and the persons of foreign origin settled in sikkim, like the
nepalis or persons of indian origin who had settled down in sikkim generations back' stands
deleted.
my lord, this was, people from sikkim were entitled to a tax exemption.
the question was, who all were citizens of sikkim. even an innocuous sentence saying that
there was no difference, then, my lords had huge emotive consequences and my lords, i
say this with some experience, particularly when i went to shaheen bagh, was that people
resent greatly when their indianness is questioned.
we are all indians and to borrow an americanism, we may have come on different
boats, but we are in the same ship.
well, the nineteenth of july nineteen forty eight, actually is the date of the introduction
of the permit system?
yes. i was actually just looking at three thousand five hundred and ninety nine.
yes, my lords. just, let's actually read it because nobody had read it to us.
then, my learned brothers will also have the benefit of that.
please, my lord, if your lordships. just, and then we'll be done.
the other things you have orally told us, i've also got. three thousand five hundred
and ninety nine. three thousand five hundred and ninety nine.
this was not constituent assembly debate, this was a debate in connection with, what?
with regard to citizenship itself.
if your lordship sees the earlier pages.
this is part of the constituent assembly debate?
yes, please, my lord. just that part you know dot i quote ll show you.
you can read that one middle of.
when i come.
this permit system. you need not give the whole para, okay alright, just about ten
lines down.
this permit system was introduced from the nineteenth of july.
this provision had to be introduced because the government of india, in dealing with persons
who left for pakistan and who subsequently returned from pakistan to india, allowed them to
come and settle permanently under the system which is called a permit system. this permit
system was introduced from the nineteenth of july, nineteen forty eight.
therefore, the provision contained in article five (b) deals with citizenship of persons, who after
coming from pakistan, went to pakistan and returned to india. provision is made that if
a person has come on the basis of a permit issued to him, for resettling
or permanent return he alone would be entitled to become a citizen on the date
of commencement of the constitution. i may say, sir, that it is not possible to
cover every kind of case for a limited purpose, namely, the purpose of conferring citizenship
on the date of the commencement of the constitution. if there is any category of
persons who are left out by the provisions contained in this amendment we have given
power to parliament subsequently to make provision for them.
i suggest to the house that the amendments which i have proposed are sufficient for
the purpose and for the moment, and i hope the house will be able to
accept these amendments.
so, that my lords, is why the date was chosen and the architecture put in,
that in the beginning we have to decide who are our citizens, who will then
be voters who will then participate in the general elections.
my lords, curiously, all this thing about permits and if you went over to pakistan
had also consequences on facts of each case.
there was a gentleman who went to school in bombay. then he went.
then, thereafter he went off to the us for further studies.
he then had property in bombay. his family had property.
he wanted to hold on to it, he asserted that he was an indian citizen.
his family was in karachi, he became a minister out there, and then when questions
came about his citizenship, it was as late as november ' fifty eight that he
withdrew his petition before this court to assert that he was an indian citizen.
the gentleman's name was zulfikar ali khan bhutto. and he chose a citizenship whose supreme
court then probably did not do him justice.
be that as it may say, it's an oddity.
there were all kinds of people alright now, i think we'll conclude there because we
have to finish.
just two minutes, my lord, i pointed out mirajkar and i would also urge your
lordship that any large scale decision which may have an inadvertent consequence of statelessness.
that you have made a point.
thank you mister hegde. who is next, now?
please, my lords. i'm grateful.
i'll be very, very brief because everything has been argued in extent.
so, i appear for asom gana parishad, i have filed ia number seven four zero
six one in writ petition number five hundred and sixty two of twenty twelve.
and my lords, my ia is in volume three, page sixteen thirty four.
mister das, iowa. number?
seven four zero six one of twenty twenty three in writ petition civil number five
hundred and sixty two of twenty twelve.
and we've filed our one page written submission.
brief submission is at page two, right?
two and three, volume two-c. my lords, i just have two broad submissions.
one, my lords, that we are signatories to the original assam accord. two, i fully
support the learned attorney and the learned solicitor and i just wanted to point out
one judgment which has not been cited on general versus specific which is twenty fourteen,
eight scc three hundred nineteen.
and i just wanted to lay emphasis on just two paras.
what is the name of the case?
the name of the case is commercial tax officer, rajasthan versus binani cements limited and
i just wanted to point out only two paras, paras thirty six and forty seven,
only to answer your lordship's query, why assam, why not bengal, etcetera.
para thirty six, my lords may kindly have.
the maxim, generalia specialibus non derogant is dealt with in volume forty four (one) of
the fourth edition of halsbury's laws in england, at para thirteen hundred as follows, 'the
principal defence clearly from the decisions of the house of lords in so and so,
and the privy council in baker versus edgar, and has been affirmed and put to
effect on many occasions.
if parliament has considered all the circumstances of, and made special provision for a particular
case, the presumption is that a subsequent enactment of a purely general character would not
have been intended to interfere with that provision.
and therefore, if such an enactment, although inconsistent in substance, is capable of reasonable and
sensible application without extending to the case'.
para forty seven.
so, you are saying that six a was a special provision intended to deal with
a specific.?
i am deeply obliged.
got it.
thank you.
thank you.
who is next now?
mister cu singh. yes. my lords, rather than give your lordship numbers, if my lords
just takes.
we've got the number.
it's one one seven zero seven four of twenty nineteen.
and one eight one five one one of twenty nineteen.
so, my written submissions, are in volume two, page one hundred and nineteen to one
hundred and seventy two.
volume?
volume two, page one hundred and nineteen to one hundred and seventy two.
and the one page note is at page four of volume two-c, and there are
just three main points which i'll very quickly go over.
the first is, the learned attorney general in para seven of the note, my lords,
may just note this, learned attorney general in para seven of the note and the
learned solicitor general at paras one to six of his written submissions in volume two,
page three,.
volume two, page three, paras one to six.
and the learned attorney general, there was a note, paragraph seven of that.
i have relied on trilok chand, to say that delay in this case should, my
lord, be a complete answer, this, your lordships, ought not to even enter into the
so called merits of the challenges, because this is not a case where.
there are petitioners who are merely seeking assertion of some right of their own.
here, the petitioners are seeking assertion of a right, which would strip away other people,
of rights which have accrued to them over a twenty seven or thirty year period.
today it's forty years but in twenty twelve, when they filed a petition, it was
a twenty seven year period, and there are constitutional rights have accrued, which are the
right to have rights.
people have become citizens by naturalization, because six a is a sort of species of
naturalization.
they have become citizens by birth etc, etcetera.
and all that is sought to be stripped away.
now. what is the next point, now?
on this point, what is very important, and this is where i come in.
the argument was, that they cited the judgment of the learned two judge bench in
assam sanmilita, to say that trilok chand ought to be reconsidered.
what the two judge bench failed to notice, was that trilok chand had been followed
by another constitution bench in rabindra nath bose, which your lordships will find, in volume
five, at page twelve fifty five.
volume?
volume five, page twelve fifty five, rabindra nath bose. (nineteen seventy), one scc eighty four.
it's in my one page note, my lords, in para two.
now, what is important is that in rabindra nath bose, an express plea was made
that trilok chand needs to be reviewed, and was rejected by the constitution bench. so,
my lords, may just straight away come to page twelve sixty six of volume five,
i'll just show two short passages.
not necessary.
we're making a note of it.
just tell us the paragraphs, that's all.
para thirty one at page twelve sixty six of volume five and para thirty two
and thirty three.
in para thirty two, there's an express plea.
at page?
page twelve sixty six to twelve sixty seven of volume five.
the plea for review has been also rejected by a cb?
by a cb and para thirty two is that express plea for a review.
fair enough, you've made the point and the cb goes on the basis of accrued
rights of others.
here the seniority rules were challenged, they said that people have now benefitted from seniority,
that they have moved on, and therefore article thirty two.
so, there's a categorical.
the statement of law by the cb that where third party rights have accrued, article
thirty two will not be invoked and will not.
the point is that if we accept.
the point which has been made on your side is that if we accept the
submission of the petitioners, it will also result in statelessness because.
.
statelessness. and the solicitor also pointed out that, the joint communiqué of sheikh mujibur rahman
and the then prime minister of india, stated that bangladesh assumed responsibility for those who
entered india post two thousand and.
sorry, post the twenty fifth of march seventy one.
' seventy one.
so, now this is one part i submit.
that was not open.
alright, next point now.
and if at all, if at all, they were right, that would have to be
referred to a seven judge bench. alright, next point.
so that's not really open.
next point.
now, the next point is, my lords that one of the principal arguments, really, when
they file these petitions was, that the assam accord has been picked.
there's a picking and choosing and only six a has.
the part of assam accord, which has been implemented is only that which was enacted
in the form of six a and the rest of the assam accord has not
been implemented, leading to supposed large scale, my lord, migration into india and what they
call infiltration and so on and so forth in the state of assam. now, the
petitioners themselves prevailed on the court while making a reference to your lordships and the
five judge bench, to continue to entertain the petition and to implement all the rest
of the assam accord. and between twenty fourteen and twenty twenty one, in fact in
large measure, all the other provisions have been implemented, all the border fencing, the searchlights,
etcetera., etcetera., the beefing up of security on the borders and my lords, the supposed
weeding out of the infiltration.
got your point.
now, if you can go to point number four, mister singh. just i. there is
something much more important which we want you to explain from your note.
this is okay that they.
i just want to point out the affidavit, that this will come on affidavit.
so, my lord, may just note that now we are in.
you know.
no, i only want to tell your lordships. intervenors now, we have to get on
with the rejoinder.
no, absolutely.
now, go to para four, just explain that, because that's a conceptual point nobody else
has made.
yes. section six a, does not violate article fourteen, but is rather a step forward
to legalize the determination of foreigners as per the assam accord signed with stakeholders who
led the agitation and definitely does not violate article fourteen rights of the petitioners, this
section may be treated as a version of citizenship by naturalization under section six read
with the third schedule. now, my lord. just read it and, so that we'll be
able to understand.
the only difference being, that whereas section six, did not apply to countries in the
first schedule, with the creation of bangladesh in nineteen seventy one, the said exclusion became
meaningless as far as its citizens were concerned, and a special provision was needed to
deal with them.
and just as grant of citizenship to any person under section six, does not violate
article fourteen, grant of citizenship to a class of persons under section six a does
not violate the right to equality.
explain this.
point in.
citizenship by naturalization is based on continuous residence in a country.
in our case, it was seven years originally, then it was made into eleven years.
so a person who is not an illegal and is residing in a country for
a particular period, can then ask for citizenship by naturalization under section six, read with
the third schedule. third schedule sets out the conditions.
section six, it is granted to people.
now, six a, is a sort of species of that because it is again based
on continuous residence here.
but what happened was, because pakistan in nineteen forty.
in nineteen fifty five pakistan had.
east and west pakistan had a very special status with india. so, the first schedule
said that six.
section six said that, naturalization will not apply to citizens of those nations named in
the first schedule, that first schedule is now repealed.
but it was.
so basically citizens of east and west pakistan were not eligible, to that particular route.
now, in nineteen seventy one, bangladesh, is now no longer part of pakistan. it is
a friendly nation.
it has no, it has never had even one day of history of enmity or
war or anything with india. it's no longer pakistan. the reality is that once bangladesh
was formed in december nineteen seventy one, it has been.
in fact, we were the midwives who helped to give birth to that nation.
and we have had friendly relations throughout.
so, now, conceptually, that exclusion really didn't.
it was there in the statute book.
bangladesh was still sort of a successor to.
successor. that was their argument, actually.
but being in the statute book that bar really didn't apply.
so what was done by the political settlement in the assam accord because there was
this massive agitation, etcetera., was, that you create another section where there'll be a form
of naturalization to recognize those displaced persons or refugees who have come from bangladesh and
who have lived for a long period of time in india. and therefore that it
is sort of, it's one species of that.
so, i'm only saying, just as six is never tested on fourteen, which person is
granted citizenship by naturalization, another person can't say why have you granted it to so
and so, under fourteen.
same way i'm saying that conceptually, six a should be tested on the same, that
merely because you are granting it to one class of people doesn't mean that there's
a violation and certainly not any violation of petitioner's rights.
violation might be claimed by another class who are denied citizenship.
another people say i am identical to mister singh, why am i not given citizenship
when he's been given it.
but can somebody else say, why are you giving it to him and not to
others, a person who is not eligible for it, so this is just the slight
thing.
now the last thing.
last thing, i'll only give you the page numbers, and i'll close that.
the para five, six a did not encourage further infiltration but rather created a fetter,
the state's population growth post nineteen seventy one compared with the rest of the country
does not support the argument that it encouraged infiltration, see union of india's affidavit dated
the fifth of december twenty fourteen at paras nine to eleven and para fourteen, volume
three, pages eleven ninety two and eleven ninety five.
now, here your lordship will take three paras in particular, para nine, eleven and fourteen
of that affidavit.
and fourteen is very important because this entire alarm, i would like if your lordship
could read para fourteen at page eleven ninety five.
volume three, page eleven ninety five.
the entire alarm arose in two thousand four, a year before the sarbananda sonowal judgment
came because of his answer in rajya sabha and that answer in rajya sabha said
that one point two crore people from bangladesh are in india, of whom fifty lakhs
are in assam. that was an estimate given.
that was corrected in rajya sabha saying that there was a field survey done, and
the field survey itself said this is only hearsay by interested parties.
but that footnote saying that we have not been able to verify this, this is
only based on hearsay by interested parties, was not placed before rajya sabha, so a
correction was made before rajya sabha. please, just see that for a moment.
volume three, page eleven ninety five.
this has been virtually the foundation of all this.
the previous paras gave the charts in the same.
i showed your lordship, eleven ninety two, etcetera., now eleven ninety five.
it is respectfully submitted that the petitioner. this is the union of india, the fifth
of december twenty fourteen, that the petitioner in the writ petition had mentioned about the
response to the rajya sabha unstarred question three hundred thirty two, dated the fourteenth of
july two thousand four, wherein it was informed that there were one point two crore
illegal immigrants, illegal bangladeshi nationals living in different parts of the country, out of them
fifty lakhs were in assam. in this connection, it is clarified that a statement correcting
the answer to the rajya sabha unstarred question was placed in the house stating that
the estimated number of illegal immigrants reported by the field organization had a clarificatory note
which was inadvertently not seen.
the clarificatory note made it clear that the reported figures were not based on any
comprehensive of sample study, but were based on hearsay, and that too from interested parties.
therefore, no realistic figures can be given for illegal bangladeshi migrants in assam. in the
case of west bengal also the figures are based on unreliable estimates and are incorrect.
a copy of the statement correcting the answer to the rajya sabha unstarred question is
annexed herewith and marked as annexure r-one.
now, if your lordship, just moves two pages back to eleven ninety two, the actual
figures.
eleven ninety two, para nine, yes. there's been a lot of alarmism, my lords, which
is not rooted or grounded in reality.
now, see the actual figures at para nine my lords, of the same affidavit.
yes. it is submitted.
may i read that my lords?
yes. it is submitted, that as per records available.
para nine, my lords, at eleven ninety two.
it is submitted that as per records available, about fifty two point three one lakh
displaced persons from former east pakistan, had migrated to india between nineteen forty six and
nineteen seventy one.
just these two paras, very short paras my lords, at para nine and ten.
it is submitted that as per records available, about fifty two point three one lakh
displaced persons from former east pakistan had migrated to india between nineteen forty six and
nineteen seventy one.
out of these, the displaced persons numbering forty one point one seven lakh, who arrived
up to the thirty first of march nineteen fifty eight, were called old migrants and
those who arrived between january first sixty four and the twenty fifth of march seventy
one, numbering about eleven point one four lakhs were called new migrants.
out of the forty one point one seven lakhs old migrants, about thirty one point
three two lakh were settled in west bengal and four point eight seven lakh persons
in assam. out of the new migrants numbering eleven point one four lakhs, two point
one two lakhs persons came to assam. the remaining old and new migrants were rehabilitated
in different states of the country under various schemes of the government of india. wide
range of relief and rehabilitation measures were undertaken by the government of india for rehabilitation
of old and new migrants.
the rehabilitation of old migrants was, by and large, completed by the end of nineteen
sixties and that of new migrants in nineteen eighties.
it is submitted that the state of assam also witnessed migration from other provinces of
undivided india, even before partition of the country, due to economic reasons and your lordships
will see this decadal variation between nineteen eleven and nineteen fifty one or nineteen sixty
one, there's a huge amount, much higher than the national variation.
the decadal growth in assam, nineteen eleven, nineteen twenty one, etcetera.
now historically, this has been well recognized, and we've.
in my written submission, i've set this out that, my lords, even in the nineteenth
century, leave alone the twentieth century, there was a lot of bengali settlements in assam,
and it led to a lot of, because at one time bengali was made the
official language, for about twelve years, in the nineteenth century, the british had made it
the official language of assam. that had led to huge resentment.
so every time bengalis settled in assam. this has nothing to do with pakistan or
india. this is way before independence.
there was always resentment.
there was always an upsurge of this fervour, and rightly so.
i'm only pointing out this has to be kept in mind.
this alarmism has a historical background to it, which must be kept in mind, because
ultimately, human beings in large numbers get affected, by an alarm against a race, not
people from pakistan, by a race of people who happen to be settled over there,
over the last one hundred fifty and two hundred years.
deeply obliged, my lords. thank you mister singh. miss trivedi, you are for the.
my lords, para the ninth of may be seen with para fourteen, that's all.
of course, numbers may not decide the validity but.
let's see.
fourteen also.
read out fourteen.
that rajya sabha clarification, that was based on hearsay.
the learned solicitor's paras one to six are very clear in your submission.
she's appearing for.
miss malvika trivedi. aasu in writ petition civil, five hundred and sixty two of twenty
twelve.
my lords, respondent number six, in writ petition five hundred and sixty two, of twenty
twelve, and respondent number five, in writ petition eight hundred and seventy six, of twenty
fourteen.
my one page of written submissions are in volume two-c, pages seven to eight, pdf
nine, ten.
page number?
pdf page nine, ten, my lord. volume two c, na?
pages seven, eight, my lord, just to.
just to give a brief background on all assam students union, because a question had
come from the hon'ble court that, why assam and why not west bengal?
the answer lies herein.
it is because of this long agitation from nineteen seventy nine to nineteen eighty five.
let's read that note, actually so that.
please, my lord, that first part of my note.
let's read that, it's important, actually.
let's read it.
so, my lords, the first point.
the backdrop of the assam accord, dated the fifteenth of august nineteen eighty five.
the assam accord was signed between the union of india, state of assam, all assam
students union and all assam gana sangram parishad in the backdrop of a six year
long movement, nineteen seventy nine to nineteen eighty five in the state, against the unabated
illegal migration of foreigners into assam, their settlement in assam and their inclusion in the
voters list.
during the agitation about eight hundred and sixty persons who are considered as martyrs during
the assam movement lost their lives and thousands were injured due to police action.
very recently, the martyrs day was actually in commemoration of these people who had lost
their lives was held, in assam. the state suffered tremendous political uncertainty, with four changes
of government and three spells of president's rule, during the six year period.
and this is very important, my lords, clause thirteen and fourteen of the assam accord,
because this is on restoration of normalcy, which is the underlying concept under section six
a, that is the purpose it was brought into for the purposes of restoration of
peace and normalcy in the state of assam. and a book that sums it up,
the quest for modern assam, by arupjyoti saikia, which is also a part of the
compilation.
it has two chapters on, each and every meeting that had gone on that time
with the government and with the all assam students union. the run up till nineteen
eighty three, thereafter in nineteen eighty five, after the prime minister's assassination.
then in nineteen eighty five, what were the events which led to the agreement behind
this assam accord, and then it came into play.
and the background that was discovered, was also discussed and when finally agreed upon, were
the nineteen sixty four riots which had happened in east pakistan, where there was mass
massacre of the populations and therefore they had escaped into india. so therefore, they became
a part of the nineteen sixty seven electoral rolls. so, therefore that part of the
population that had come in at that stage was included, but the part after that,
then the government agreed, would be kept disenfranchised.
therefore, the period till nineteen seventy one where they were not included in the electoral
rolls. so, therefore in the history of this entire accord is the agitation and therefore,
the difference between west bengal and assam for the purposes of this particular section.
now, coming to my second point where a lot of arguments were raised by the
petitioners on the infiltration continuing.
for that, i just want to point out one para, from the reference order itself.
para forty six is very important because the points that we are making here is,
that the constitutional vires of a statutory provision cannot be tested on the basis of
faulty or inadequate implementation, of the said provision.
and if, my lords, will only have para forty six of the reference order, it
says, if i may just read the introduction.
'on an overall consideration of the immediate dimensions of the issues and the potential that
the same have for the future.
we issue the following directions under article one hundred and forty two of the constitution
of india. one is border fencing, border roads and provision for flood lights.
the second is foreigners's tribunals. the third is existing mechanism of deportation of declared illegal
migrants.
and in that, forty eight point one preparatory work, such as selection of vendor system,
development by system integrator, appointment of staff and training, etcetera., has already been directed to
be completed by the end of january twenty fifteen by order dated the twenty seventh
of november twenty fourteen of the court. four eight dot two comma the remaining work
of updating the nrc will now conform to the following time schedule, which will be
strictly adhered to.
and forty nine, all the cases, so on and so forth'.
so, therefore, if my lords will see that this is the implementation that had to
be carried out as per the assam accord, absence of this implementation cannot be a
reason to fault section six a. then coming to the third point, which has already
been addressed, so i will only talk about the case law very briefly to say,
that the petitioners also disentitled from claiming the relief on account of inordinate delay, and
for that i only want to point out that whether it is ramchandra shankar deodhar,
whether it is rabindra nath bose or whether it is trilok chand, the underlying concept
in all these judgments is that, if the rights of another set of people have
already got created, then the delay in filing the petition cannot be then waived off.
and my lords will just see, i have just given a few instances when they
could have challenged and they did not, and therefore these rights have now crystallized over
forty years.
one instance that i've given, the report by the lieutenant general sk sinha was prepared
on zero eight - eleven ninety eight, which in detail talked about this problem.
then comes that reply to the unstarred question the fourteenth of july twenty twelve.
absolutely. and the writ petition sarbananda sonowal which was filed in two thousand.
absolutely. and this actually considers the assam accord in para eighteen and in para thirty
three in great detail.
the next point i will just.
on the legislative competence, i just want to point out one article, just for the
purposes of saying that, how five, six and seven.
articles, five, six, seven, the purpose was that they would work themselves out at the
commencement of the constitution. i only want to point out article three hundred ninety four.
if i may read?
this article and article five, six, seven, eight, nine.
sixty, three hundred and twenty four, three hundred and sixty six, three hundred and sixty
seven shall come into force at once, and the remaining provisions of this constitution shall
come into force on the twenty sixth day of january, nineteen fifty, which day is
referred to in this constitution as the commencement of this constitution. so, therefore, my lords,
the other, the five, six, seven, articles were supposed to come into effect on the
twenty sixth of november nineteen forty nine and therefore at the commencement of the constitution.
therefore, by the twenty sixth of january nineteen fifty, they were supposed to come into
play for the grant of citizenship.
and thereafter, therefore, we have said that the purpose of article eleven was only to
add, not to deprive anybody, but to add a certain class of persons which were
not covered by articles five to nine.
that is the point that i've covered in point four.
i have also given detailed submissions my lords, which is there already on record.
another judgment that i wanted to add, because izhar ahmad, when it discusses in great
detail, article eleven, it is a constitution bench judgment.
it is very clear on what article eleven entails, and it has been followed in
state of up versus shah mohammad. i have given the volume number and the pages
and also the para, para five of the state of up versus shah mohammad. it's
a case very similar to izhar ahmad, and it follows izhar ahmad and again reiterates
that article eleven is supposed to then come into play for the purposes of the
laws to be made for citizenship.
my fifth point very briefly, i have tried to state that section six a is
not the only statutory provision to be based on a political agreement, and i have
given two instances for this article three hundred seventy one (a), which is the thirteenth
amendment act, and it is based on the agreement between the government of india and
the leaders of the naga people's convention. then i've also cited sixth schedule, which is
based on the memorandum of settlement, entered into between the government of india, government of
assam and bodo liberation tigers, and this is now on the autonomous districts and autonomous
regions.
it covers the areas in the state of assam, meghalaya, tripura and mizoram. then i
have just added some case law, to say that the classification on the basis of
historical or geographical reasons, is absolutely valid, and therefore i have only added the judgment
in state of mp versus bhopal sugar, was already cited before my lords. i have
only added one more judgment on geographical classification, which is ram krishna dalmia versus justice
sr tendolkar. and i have also added clarence pais versus union of india. and in
the end, i am only making a point, that if the history of this agitation
is seen, it is actually wonderfully spelt out in the quest for modern assam, which
is also a part of volume four-a, by arupjyoti saikia. it will be very clear
that what had happened throughout this process, and why because of the bihar settlers, why
because of the bengali language, and why this agitation became much more than what the
people of assam could handle, and therefore for peace and normalcy, the section six a
was brought about.
thank you so much.
thank you miss trivedi. may it please your lordships. my lords, i'll make a very
quick five points.
your lordships will not have to be.
you're in ia twenty four of twenty seventeen?
ia my lords, is twenty four of twenty seventeen.
assam state jamiat ulama-i-hind. that's right, the state jamiat. my lords, we've been deeply involved
in all the caa matters, etcetera., etcetera., and we've been involved in the assam accord
settlement, right from the beginning.
my lords, we have very.
i will not repeat anything that my learned colleagues have said.
where is your note, mister?
your lordships will find the note in volume two-c at pages five to six.
pdf page seven.
yes. and my lords, the earlier note that i had given.
your lordships will find in volume two.
that is the details are all given there.
this is very very brief, because your lordships want to just.
let have a look at your notes, mister khurshid. so, if your lordships will see
at pdf page seven, volume two-c. my lords, the first point, if your lordships will
focus on that.
the first point, essentially, is to disclose that the migration issue is a global issue,
and for assam, it continued over centuries.
so, it wasn't as though something had suddenly happened and the amalgam of different communities
moving into migration, bringing different communities into assam, gave what sociologists have said, is a
salad bowl, my lords, two perceptions about a salad bowl and about a mosaic or
on the other hand, it would be a melting pot, so the preferred view seems
to be of a salad bowl.
this is how it existed, my lords, but of course if your lordships yourself have
heard from the others.
there were issues that were different as far as the western.
western border was concerned and the eastern border.
the issues on the eastern border was the constant move from one part of bengal
to another part of bengal. so, assam was in a sense separate because they didn't
want to impact on the issues between the two parts of bengal. assam then therefore
becomes, in a sense, collateral to that issue.
so, assam issue was never resolved in terms of the permit system that was introduced
in the west. and the permit system, your lordships might recall, was particularly focused on
the issue that people who had left and their homes had been given to refugees
coming in from western part or from west pakistan could not then, be asked to
evacuate their homes that they were given as refugees, to return to people who had
come back.
and therefore the permit system was particularly carefully monitored.
this didn't happen in the eastern part, and particularly as, your lordships saw justice baharul
islam's judgment, his speech in the rajya sabha. we've mentioned all that here my lords,
and therefore a separate issue had to be framed, as far as the eastern side
was concerned.
and that, of course the ' sixty four was obviously a landmark point, ' sixty
four, ' sixty six follows, because ' sixty four follows, with the ' sixty seven
electoral rolls. but the critical matters is the nineteen seventy one.
nineteen seventy one, if your lordships will see here, in point number two, if your
lordship will see, bangladesh had already introduced their citizenship law in nineteen seventy two.
we were introducing in nineteen eighty five.
so, in effect, the nineteen seventy one aligns itself with the bangladesh law. so, there
is no gap between indian citizenship and bangladesh citizenship. your lordships were asking, if it
had something to do with, operation searchlight and the migrations that would have been caused
due to distress, because of the pakistani army operating.
the bangladesh government said they would take back all the people who had moved during
that period, because if they were in bangladesh on the first day, which was on
twenty fifth of march, there would be citizens under the ' seventy two law.
and therefore, we were only concerned with people who were not in bangladesh on the
twenty fifth of march, those citizens would be taken care of, or those people would
be taken care of by the indian law and it aligns.
now my lords, if for any reason the ' seventy one alignment is changed, for
any reason, it would mean that forty years later, there are huge number of stateless
citizens.
something to which we are not yet as far as the convention is concerned.
but government of india has always been careful, about not creating or not being seen
in the world as creating stateless citizens.
and that is very critical point why your lordships would wish to uphold that '
seventy one, as the so called cutoff date, though there is some issue about whether
it should be called a cutoff date at all.
that's point number two in my submissions.
and point number three, only follows upon what arguments have already been made, that it
didn't freeze.
the issue of citizenship didn't freeze in nineteen forty eight, under the citizenship act of
nineteen fifty five, it continued with six a, and then it continued subsequently in twenty
nineteen, when further amendments were made for citizenship.
those may well be under challenge, but at least in theory, it was possible for
the citizenship to continue in terms of fresh legislation.
and my lords, the last two important points are now there is a fresh affidavit
that's been filed by government of india. those two points, the last two points, four
and five, indicate that the alarming picture that somehow emerged is not, my learned friends
just before me had indicated this, but that alarming picture was misplaced, that the number
of people, so called coming in was completely misplaced.
firstly because the migration figures, as we now see from the affidavit, are much less
compared to the ones that have been projected earlier.
and then, my lords, in view of this affidavit, i would urge your lordships, to
consider whether the monitoring bench is the appropriate bench to continue with any issues that,
are indicated for future and many of those issues are mentioned in the affidavit, rather
than this hon'ble bench having to worry about what to do about the future of
prospects.
thank you, mister so, my lords, the only issue to recall is whether we are
a salad bowl or we are melting pot.
that's very critical in terms of sociology to understand.
your lordships have already been told about how the cultural issue was protected by the
schedules, by which the culture and autonomy of the tribes of assam was protected, and
they are the ones who should really have been concerned, not the others.
this is my submission.
deeply obliged, my lords. yes, mister i won't take more than two minutes, my lord,
yes. my application, iowa. two six eight six nine, at page no.
sixteen sixteen in volume 3, iowa. number twenty six.?
two six eight six nine at page sixteen sixteen of volume three.
and my short note, in volume two-c, page nine.
all the points raised by me, formulated by me, are adequately at this now.
so i don't want to waste the time, only to say one thing, that is,
with particular reference to arguments submission made by miss indira jaising, that aspect regarding twenty
nine a, that a fully adopted law, because otherwise i would have argued that.
thank you, mister mister farasat. my lords, i am appearing.
your lordships will have page eleven of the volume two-c. i'll only rely on the
one pager, although i've submitted a detailed written submission, page eleven of that is my
submission.
three short points for your lordships' consideration.
volume two c, page?
page eleven, is a one pager.
i appear for.
in ia ten, in wpc five hundred and sixty two for social justice forum, which
is an organization that works for a composite culture in assam. my lords, the first
submission for your lordships' consideration is that, my lords, the right to culture which they
have asserted under article twenty nine, that in my respectful submission can never extend to
denying somebody's citizenship.
the reason for that is, the citizenship regime under article fourteen, article fourteen is the
only article your lordships will normally test any citizenship regime under.
that is a regime of civic nationalism.
a non-discriminatory basis of grant of citizenship.
the minute we elevate culture to the extent of denying somebody else citizenship, effectively we
have transgressed from the area of civic nationalism to cultural nationalism.
twenty nine certainly cannot extend to denying somebody else citizenship, because the nature of citizenship
regime itself, under the constitution then changes.
that's my first respectful submission.
your lordships will have article twenty nine for just for a moment.
the language there is, have a distinct language script or culture of its own, and
shall have the right to conserve.
my lords, twenty nine is premised on a multicultural society.
it is premised on multiple cultures, and you have a right to conserve within that
multicultural space, your own culture.
it is not a right for cultural exclusivity.
that's my respectful submission to your court. the way they have framed it, that i
have a right to cultural exclusivity under twenty nine to deny others citizenship.
the language, the plain text of twenty nine does not permit that.
in fact, i would go so far as to say that, if their arguments are
accepted, article twenty nine, in effect, cease to exist because twenty nine is premised on
a multicultural society, and in that respect your lordships will have article fifty one a
of the constitution, sub-clause f. that talks about fundamental duties.
article fifty one a, sub-clause f is fundamental duties and it talks of composite culture.
every citizen's duty to maintain composite culture.
composite culture is a mix, is a bouquet of all the cultures within india. therefore,
when we read the constitution as a whole, article twenty nine can never extend to
deny somebody else citizenship.
now, just one example in that case.
for instance, in malaysia, we have bhoomiputras. literally, it translates into son of the soil.
malaysia, my lords, very similar, in facts to this situation.
due to british policy, chinese and indian migrants were moved into malaysia. the indigenous malays,
as they were, had a problem, had an angst against this movement.
now citizenship is there for everybody across the board, chinese malaysians, indian malaysians or malay
malaysians. but there is affirmative action which is provided because the malays were socio-economically backward.
so, maybe there are aspects which if they were to show that they are socio-economically
backward, my submission is nothing on the data to indicate that, then those things can
be taken care of.
but you can't pitch it so high as to citizenship and then say nobody else
will have citizenship.
that's on point one.
my lords, my second submission is that insofar as the reliance in article three hundred
and twenty five and three hundred and twenty six is concerned, three hundred and twenty
five on its own terms, i'm not going to take your lordships through it, but
on its own terms, has the same markers of non-discrimination as in article fifteen, race,
religion, caste, etcetera.
so, three hundred and twenty five in fact, goes against them because the citizenship regime
has to be based without discrimination on basis of religion, etcetera.
so many arguments, even on the grounds of change in demographics, on religion was made.
three hundred and twenty five prohibits that kind of discrimination, number one.
number two, under three hundred and twenty six, the electorate is defined.
it is by adult suffrage at intervals, it has to be.
the electoral list is changed.
my lords, that by itself envisages a continuously changing electorate.
the composition of the electorate, under three hundred and twenty six does not give a
right to any specific group to have electoral dominance, my lords, that's my submission for
your lordship's consideration.
three hundred and twenty six does not envisage that any specific group will continue to
have electoral dominance.
in fact the terms of three hundred and twenty six, are indicative that there is
a flux in society, things can keep on changing and therefore electoral roles must keep
on changing.
that's the second submission.
my third and final submission for your lordships consideration is that, assam accord was.
my lords, one aspect of the assam accord has been legalized in the form of
six a. there was another aspect, which was that a whole lot of violence occurred,
and that was.
amnesty was granted for that under the assam accord, for instance, in ' eighty three,
there was a serious massacre called the nellie massacre.
although my lords, for serious crimes, the text of assam accord says that.
that is, in effect, excluded, but the way it operated on the ground, that all
of that my lords, in effect, was effectively, amnesty was provided.
so today, my lords, after so many years, to pick on one aspect of six
a, whereas the petitioners represent groups, which benefited from non-prosecution of multiple cases my lords,
in nellie, there were deaths of fifteen hundred to two thousand bengali migrants.
so, all of that was shut out, so it's a compact, to pick out one
now, and you have benefited from other aspects of the compact, my lords, in my
respectful submission, your lordships will look at that very closely.
that's my respectful submission.
i'm extremely grateful to the court. thank you mister farasat. your lordships, my written submission
in volume two-c at page number nine, in ia number one nine zero two two
one.
i will take only one minute.
many foreigners illegally settled in the assam and also other parts of country, it affects
not only national security but also democratic setup in the assam and other states like
bengal also.
section six a confers citizenship to large number of persons without being actually born within
the territories of india. section six a seeks to provide protective discrimination to the class
of illegal immigrants.
fourth point is, there may be some lacuna and drawbacks in the provision of the
section six a of the citizenship act nineteen fifty five, as said by the petitioners.
you are saying six a is unconstitutional or constitutional?
sir, it is constitutional.
i am saying only that.
and there may be some lacuna and the drawbacks in provision of the section six
a of the citizenship act as read by the petitioner, but the intention of the
lawmakers is certainly fair.
the provision of section six a, are in favour of the integrity and national security
of india, but there should be practical approach because immigrants may be illiterate and they
cannot be at the ventilator for indefinite time.
my humble submission.
thank you, mister my humble submission is that, the provision of section six a of
the citizenship act nineteen fifty five should be declared valid and.
alright. now, who else?
my lords, i'll take exactly two minutes, and i appear for my lord 's assamar
khilonjia musalman union parishad (apkm).
give a submission, one page submission.
not one page, it's not.
have you filed some submission?
yes, your lordships. so what is your point?
who are you appearing for?
i'm appearing for.
in ia number, your lordships, in five hundred and sixty two - four one zero
three six of and in wpc two hundred and seventy four, my ia number is
one five three zero six one of twenty twenty two.
i will not bother your lordships with all the.
because everybody else has argued.
i have been.
anything special now?
yes. what is that?
otherwise, i would not bother.
to decide the questions before, my lords, in question number four, nine, ten and eleven.
there is a question of a friendly country and your lordships has been kind enough
to take affidavit of the union. i am only submitting for your lordship consideration, that
if your lordships can also ask the union to file an affidavit, qua their interactions
with this friendly nation, on point number four, nine, ten and eleven.
yes. two, my lords, six a, absolutely technically, is a restrictive in nature provision, which
restricts the rights or the provisions, which were available in six before nineteen eighty five.
so, it's not actually giving out something.
it's restricting something for the provisions of section six.
two thousand four amendments came later on.
that's the second aspect and third aspect to confine myself to three minutes, two minutes.
is.
that a culture.
point number three.
the abrogation of culture and dilution of culture, will have to be considered on the
parameter of the numbers.
if more number of people, as it happened here, lot of bengali origin people adopted
assamese language and therefore assam language today is assamese. so it is expansive in nature
again.
lot of bengali origin.
that point you made now, thank you.
i appear in special petition, number two hundred and fourteen.
what's the point?
the point is, i will only confine to two aspects.
you are for the intervenor?
no, my lord, i am in the, for the petitioner in akhtara khatun, five hundred
and one point three and five zero one dot six comma i have uploaded my
written submission just now.
that's one page only, and i confined myself only on two, three aspects.
what does the slp arise from?
this is against the order of the high court whereby the individuals were declared as
a non-citizen.
high court declared individuals as non citizens.
and that is.
against that the slp was filed.
that was an individual case.
but it has been tagged along and this item number is five hundred and one
point three. five hundred and one.
we will just de-tag your case.
we went again.
we will de-tag this case.
only, only.
we will de-tag this case, because we don't know what the.
let the bench deal with this.
why should we tag the.
the tribunal has declared as non-citizen.
then we went to high court. against the high court we came to supreme court
and it has been tagged along with this batch of petition, my lord. i will
make only two submissions.
in one minute i'll finish.
there are six slp's apparently, one second, just for clarity.
there are six slps i don't think we should be going to the facts of
slp's over here.
we'll just de-tag those matters.
i'm only on the.
you see, there, some injustice may be caused to your client because you know we
are hearing a question of law here, there's a constitutional challenge which we are considering.
individual facts will be six slp's after we deliver judgment, let it be placed before
the regular bench. it will affect the interest of my client.
i will only make legal submission, not going to take up your time.
you have not been protected under six a also, you have been held to be
a foreigner, so you will have to argue your slp on facts.
that is true, my lord, slp's has to be argued on facts.
i'm not arguing on fact.
i cannot argue before you lordship. right because it is confined only.
alright what is it in just one small sentence.
article five to article nine deals with specific, they are time and situation specific and
parliament has given under two hundred and forty six read with.
that point has been made now, that point has been made now. seventeen.
so, therefore, article ten and eleven both gives enough power.
and that point, has been.
the article five to eight, five to nine are enacted for.
thank you, thank you.
the purpose and keeping in view of the movement.
thank you.
okay. yes, mister divan. before mister divan commences, we had asked for an affidavit by
the union of india, learned solicitor was there.
can we just quickly look at the affidavit?
because then that way you can deal with the affidavit in the.
union of india dated the eleventh of december ' twenty three.
may i read, my lords?
i'm sorry, i was called somewhere.
your lordships are on page my lord. i'll.
i will not re-read my lord. that's the only reason.
from which page.
perhaps we can see, i think.
yes. my apologies my lords, i was not here.
your lordship's queries what this issue is concerned, was how many persons have been detected
to be foreigners by an order of the foreigner's tribunal. under the foreigners tribunal order
nineteen sixty four, with reference to the above period, that is ' sixty six to
' seventy one.
it is humbly submitted that the number is thirty two thousand three hundred and eighty
one, till this date, my lord. there may be few cases, my lords, which may
be pending, somewhere in the high court or before this hon'ble court.
but broadly, this number would not vary.
the. para six is the second query of my lord, the estimated inflow of illegal
migrants into india, including but not confined to the state of assam. in substance we
have said, that there is a porous border.
they come clandestinely and therefore it is not possible to give exact figure.
it may not be an accurate figure, but the situation is a grim situation, my
lord. i'll not dispute the petitioners on that.
para seven, your lordship's query was in respect of persons who are alleged to have
entered india, including state of assam, after twenty fifth of march, it is.
what is my lords, the foreigners tribunals status.
there are hundred foreigners tribunals. the total number of cases disposed of, are three, thirty
four thousand nine hundred and sixty six.
the number of cases pending are ninety seven thousand seven hundred and fourteen and against
this tribunal's order, there is a remedy before the high court and eight thousand four
hundred and sixty one cases are pending.
then my lords, the steps taken by the union government at the administrative level, to
deal with illegal immigration into territory of india, including the north eastern states, particularly the
state of assam. my lords, fencing part, i'll come a little later.
but other my lords. in last five years, ministry of home affairs, government of india,
has released a total amount of rupees one hundred twenty two crores, as monetary allocation,
for the functioning of foreigners tribunals, towards the expenditure incurred to be.
or to be incurred by the state.
then (b), monitoring of deportation of detected foreigners and convicted foreigners in the state of
assam is done by a standing committee headed by a joint secretary to the government
of india, in the ministry of external affairs, and having member from the state government
of assam. the standing committee has held six meetings so far in this regard.
the state government or union. ut administration, have been requested to take various actions with
regard to illegal immigrants.
periodic meetings are convened at the level of chief secretary and dgps to review the
enforcement of legal provisions related to illegal migrants.
police authorities in the state or union territories and other law enforcement agencies may be
constantly sensitized on the issue of illegal immigration of foreign nationals and be appraised of
the legal provisions.
police authorities and other law enforcement agencies may be advised to keep a strict vigil
and take appropriate.
are advised.
not maybe advised.
are advised.
prompt action to detect, identify, and intercept illegal immigrants settled in state or ut concerned.
adequate powers are vested with state governments or ut administration for detection, detention and deportation
of illegally staying foreign nationals.
suitable penal action may.
are taken.
there is a typo throughout.
against illegally staying foreign nationals after completion of legal proceedings the movement of such illegal
migrants may be restricted in detention or holding centres by issuing of appropriate orders under
section three (two) (e), of the foreigners act, read with para eleven of the foreigners
order nineteen forty eight.
action may also be taken against those who abate under section fourteen (c) of the
foreigners. it's taken from the directive.
therefore my lord, it is wrong expression.
my apologies.
are directed, not may.
further biographic and biometric particulars of such illegally staying foreign nationals are being taken, immediate,
necessary action to cancel fraudulently obtained indian identity document.
it is further submitted that steps have been taken by government of assam to stop
or prevent illegal immigration in assam. it is submitted that various means and mechanisms are
used to prevent and stop illegal immigration in assam, as well as detection and deportation
of illegal foreigners from assam. now second line of defence.
assam police border personnel, along with assam police, armed branch personnel are deployed in the
second line of defence behind the border of.
border outposts of the border guarding force that is bsf along the indo-bangladesh border to
keep vigil and to trace out infiltrators who might sneak past the bsf border outpost.
the second line of defence is established as per decision taken in a tripartite talks
held in march ' ninety nine, in new delhi. presently fourteen number of border outposts
and fourteen numbers of patrol posts are functional as second line of defence unit in
four districts of assam sharing international border with bangladesh to detect illegal migrants, carry out
patrolling.
just one second solicitor. further third numbered para, para, page seven.
further additional twelve border outposts were approved at the second meeting of, state level standing
committee to monitor border security, held on the twenty fourth of december twenty nineteen with
a government memo dated the thirtieth of december twenty nineteen.
these two second line of defence units play a crucial role in prevention of infiltration
and detection of illegal foreigners.
it is noteworthy to mention here, that the second line of defence that is border
outpost or police patrol is manned by both unarmed and armed branch personnel.
headed by mostly ex-servicemen, sub-inspectors who have adequate knowledge of border management security due to
their past military experience and can easily coordinate and communicate with bsf to carry out
the joint or individual patrolling.
they submitted that the border outpost or patrol post personnel are not engaged in any
other duties.
then every district in assam has a separate border branch under the command of the
district superintendent of police border.
further additional sp border, deputy sp border are specifically posted in districts to look after
the border works under command, control, guidance and supervision of superintendent of police. further in
every police station, outpost, watch post as well as foreigners tribunal, border personnel are posted
for border works.
furthermore, five hundred task forces are also formed as per the order of the hon'ble
supreme court, to apprehend the declared foreigners.
because even after declaration they escape, so that they may not be deported.
further, the assam police border organization takes necessary steps, to detect and deport the illegal
migrants from assam, as per law.
generally based on information collected during village survey, source information, public complaint and intensive revision
of electoral rolls, etcetera., regular foreign tribunal or doubtful voter cases are initiated under section
fourteen, of the foreigner's act against a suspected foreigner, if he or she is not
able to produce any valid document, in support of his or her claim of being
an indian national.
thereafter, the cases are referred to the concerned foreigners tribunal for opinion.
on receipt of foreigner tribunal's opinion, the declared foreigners are apprehended and detained in transit
camp for onward deportation to their country of origin, that is, bangladesh. then watch posts,
watch posts are established in infiltration prone areas of assam, to conduct survey to detect
infiltrators and subsequent legal action against them.
case initiation, presently one hundred and fifty nine watch posts are functioning in twenty three

border protection grid for effective border management involvement dot in volvement of various stakeholders, central
and state agencies is inevitable.
for this, the ministry of home affairs of india with a notification dated the second
of january ' eighteen had directed establishment of border protection grid along the indo bangladesh
international border with the involvement of the state authorities and other stakeholders.
government of assam has since finalized the sop of border protection grid for indo bangladesh
international border of assam. main objective of the border protection grid are as follows: to
present a foolproof mechanism with a view to make assam free from illegal immigrants by
detecting and deporting them to their country of origin and to present such infiltration.
to prevent such infiltrations in future.
to prevent cross border crimes into indo bangladesh border, the functions and responsibilities of different
stakeholders are clearly mentioned.
then intelligence agency meetings, they are frequently held.
i may skip that.
nine is relevant, with reference to the query, the extent of border fencing which has
been carried out.
the steps which the union government intends to take, to complete the exercise of border
fencing, an estimated timelines to complete the exercise of border fencing.
india shares four thousand and ninety six point seven kilometre of international border with bangladesh.
it passes through the state of west bengal, meghalaya, mizoram, tripura and assam. the border
is porous, crisscrossed by rivers, hilly and mountainous terrains.
out of four thousand and ninety six point seven kilometre, indo-bangladesh border length, feasible length
for fence is about three thousand nine hundred and twenty two kilometres and non-feasible length
is about one hundred and seventy four point five kilometers.
when there is a mountainous terrain or river, there is no fencing possible.
to secure the indo bangladesh border, government of india has taken multipronged step to complete
the remaining length, either by fencing, fence or by technological solutions.
for the entire indo bangladesh border, about eighty one point five percent fence work has
been completed in feasible length and work is going on in those feasible stretches where
encumbrance free site is available.
further, about twenty eight point two percent of non-feasible gaps that is riverine, nala gaps,
etcetera., in assam and tripura have been covered by deploying technological solutions.
in remaining parts, in west bengal, meghalaya and mizoram, suitable technological solutions are being explored
in consultation with defence research development organization and central public works department. in addition to
above, keeping in view the vulnerability of the border bsf had carried out a vulnerable
mapping exercise to identify the vulnerable stretches, non-feasible stretches or stretches along existing fence along
the indo-bangladesh border.
to cover these vulnerable stretches, government of india has sanctioned a low cost technological solutions
covering a total length of two hundred and eighty one kilometers along indo-bangladesh border, which
is in progress and likely to be completed by september, twenty twenty four.
further, the government of india reviews the progress of fencing work regularly through institutionalized mechanisms
like empowered committee on border infrastructure being headed by the cabinet secretary, high level empowered
committee being headed by the union home secretary, steering committee being headed by the secretary
border management, state level standing committee being headed by the chief secretary of concerned states.
apart from this to expedite the border fence work, it is being reviewed in ministry
at joint secretary border management one level and director level, monthly and weekly, respectively.
all efforts are being made to secure the remaining length of indo-bangladesh border, either by
fence or by technological solutions.
the fence work is likely to be completed in three years’ time after availability of
encumbrance free site.
the site is to be provided by the state, that's the problem.
and the technological solutions are expected to be put in place in two years’ time.
specifically, state of assam shares approximately two hundred and sixty three kilometres of international border
with bangladesh. out of which two hundred and ten kilometres has been covered by fence
and remaining non-feasible length has been covered by technological solutions.
it is specifically submitted that challenges have also been faced in the state of west
bengal with regard to illegal immigration.
it is submitted that the state of west bengal shares about two thousand two hundred
and sixteen kilometers border with bangladesh. out of two thousand two hundred and sixteen point
seven kilometers of international border with bangladesh, seventy eight percent border of feasible length is
covered with fence.
the details of remaining length of feasible or non-feasible stretches in the state of west
bengal is as under.
i've given the figures.
and (a) the status of feasible length in west bengal. it is submitted that a
feasible length of four hundred and thirty five kilometers remains to be covered by the
fence.
it is submitted that out of the same two hundred and eighty six point three
five kilometers is pending due to land acquisition.
acquisition by the state. further, it may be noted, that about one hundred and forty
nine point one five four kilometre stretch including bridges, culverts, gaps, low lying, public protest,
et., which were earlier considered to be non-feasible, has now been considered to be feasible
for installation of physical barriers, including fencing, sentry post, high mast light, etcetera., as per
bsf and cpwd recommendation.
estimates are being prepared to cover this stretch, also.
it is submitted that despite all efforts, the progress has been substantially hindered due to
the pending land acquisition issues with the government of west bengal. the state government has
not adopted right to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition and rehabilitation act twenty
thirteen.
as per this act, in cases of urgency, the appropriate government can take possession of
any land needed for public purpose, and such land shall thereupon vest absolutely in the
government, free from all encumbrances.
it is submitted that west bengal government follows a far slower, more complex, direct land
purchase policy.
this is my lords, the main hindrance, even for national security projects such as border
fencing.
due to the non cooperation from the state government regarding resolving various issues of land
acquisition, considerable delays have occurred in acquiring the necessary land, thereby impeding the timely completion
of fencing in west bengal along indo-bangladesh border, which is a vital national security project.
my lord, i have avoided giving any correspondence, discussions, details, etcetera., with a view, not
to make it other than, my lords, just fact specific.
but this is the problem we are facing and the central government can do little
in land acquisition.
then status of non-feasible length in west bengal. mister solicitor, who pays the compensation, union
or the state?
the state. but if this is not the cause for which urgency clause is to
be invoked, i don't think there can be any other cause.
integrity of the state, security of the country.
direct land purchase policy usually is adopted in case when you are acquiring land for
some industrial purpose or industrial township, etcetera., not for national security concerns the issue is
of compensation, mainly.
correct, my lord, but that has to be priority, even if.
no, i am sorry my lord, i stand corrected.
for border fencing, we pay the compensation.
only they are the agency which can do it under the land acquisition act. but
they follow the direct purchase policy?
direct purchase policy.
they may follow.
we have no difficulty but for border fencing, they cannot follow.
an urgency clause will have to be invoked and my lord, i'm sorry, i stand
corrected, the union of india pays the compensation.
then status of non feasible length in west bengal. it is submitted that the length
of non-feasible stretch to be completed is one twelve point seven eight zero kilometers which
falls in sundarbans areas and is being planned to be covered by deploying technological solutions.
a joint physical inspection has been carried out by bsf and cpwd to explore the
feasibility for construction of nine number of outpost towers in sundarbans areas, which can house
surveillance equipment.
it is further submitted, that the ministry has also sanctioned three hundred and one point
two five kilometre replacement, upgradation of new design fence in west bengal. out of this
fifty six point two one kilometers new design fence work is in progress and for
remaining length tendering is in process.
it is submitted that to secure the indo-bangladesh border in west bengal, government of india
has taken multipronged steps to complete the remaining length either by fence or by technological
solutions.
if the state of west bengal co-operates in acquiring the land and handing over the
land for fencing, the central government shall complete the process without any delay.
this is in respectful response to the order passed by your lordships, on the earlier
occasion.
before the petitioner starts only one thing.
i don't think my lord that may have any relevance for the purpose of deciding
validity of section six a. but some history referred to by my learned senior friend.
it seems he has read a wrong book of history.
assam was never a part of myanmar, because this has some relevance when we deal
with some other matter, at some other level, in some other composition.
it was never a part.
because myanmar has now maximum immigration.
and therefore to say that it was always a part of assam. i only said.
to myanmar. they wanted assam. then the british my lord, who took it over.
that's what i said and i referred to in the chapter in the history dot
in the book, my lords, which says.
that's.
that's not my statement, i mean this is completely.
quite frankly, the website of the assam government also says the same thing.
anyway, i don't wish to join issue on that, my lord, but this was the
wrong book my learned friend read.
that's all.
i. kindly look at your own website.
it says exactly that.
your own website.
let's not get into.
anyway, i leave it at that.
i don't want to embarrass, mister sibal. lordship, just give me half a second.
part of the compilation.
the treaty.
permission of the, the issue of my lord, influx from myanmar is separately pending before
your lordships, and there are other issues also pending.
therefore, i repeatedly.
mister hegde, also said the same thing.
this is confined to the validity of six a. let's confine ourselves to six a.
the validity of six-a, because.
context of not being able to map, the movement of population.
that's all that i was saying.
alright. yes, mister divan. question of delay in.
i should have given your lordships a citation just the principle like this.
yes. if a wrongful act causes an injury which is complete, a damage arising out
of wrongful act, even continuous, will not be a continuous wrong.
that is, in nineteen fifty nine, supplement to scr four hundred and seventy six. nineteen.?
nineteen fifty nine, supplement to scr four hundred and seventy six.
paragraph thirty nine of the judgment, what they say is there is a distinction between
a continuing wrong and a wrong or a default which is complete when it is
committed.
so, nineteen seventy one, assam accord so complete will is committed.
this judgment has been quoted with approval in the ram janmabhumi case that is (twenty
twenty) one scc one which is a constitution bench. twenty twenty?
twenty twenty one scc one.
thats it.
yes. now, may i just request you to take up the citizenship act please, and
with your permission, i will only make points and points in rejoinder.
so i'll go point wise.
yes. now, the first set of points is what i understand.
there's common ground, because, we've now heard what the respondents have to say.
so, i think the first is quite obvious that we are only concerned with assam.
there's a geographic limit.
we are all agreed on that.
the second point is, i took in the written, the respondent's reply, it appears that
it's now common ground, that there's no temporal limit to the operation of section six
a. the solicitor general once mentioned transitory provision.
i'll come to that separately.
but six a applies even to this day.
it's not as if six a applies and there is a cutoff date or a
cutoff point of time, i think that's very, very important.
whereas, you can make an application even today for the purposes of gaining a benefit
under section six a. and i think that's very important.
and it's common ground now that there is no, therefore, temporal limits to six or
the operational six a. the third point which i wish to make on which, again,
there is commonality is, both sides are agreeing that for the benefit of six a,
the notion of ordinarily resident in assam is crucial and vital.
there's no running away from that.
ordinarily resident in assam is an embedded notion as far as the statute is concerned,
whether you're under two, you're under three, that's an important feature.
and the final point which i want to make on which i think there is
now commonality is with regard to the essential ingredients for the operation of six a.
number one, the person must be of indian origin as defined.
number two, she must come into assam. number three, she must come from bangladesh and
number four, what i mentioned a while ago, must be ordinarily resident in assam. these
are the four, so we have now all agreed on with regard to those essential
requirements.
now, please take up the citizenship.
go directly to section six a. now i'll just make my points.
i am focusing initially on six a (two).
please, take up six a (two).
first point, it's now common ground that there is no machinery for the purposes of
evaluating, assessing and determining the grant of citizenship under six a (two).
no machinery.
now, notice, the legislature prescribes four criteria.
please take up six a (two).
it prescribes the four criteria i indicated.
it then provides no machinery for determining any of the four criteria, which is, is
the person of indian origin, has the person entered assam before january first sixty six,
has the person entered from bangladesh and is the resident, ordinarily resident in assam?
there are four specific criteria but these four specific criteria are factual to qualify under
six a (two), you must meet these conditions.
you must meet the.
that's what the legislature says, but there's no machinery to determine these conditions.
so, what is the net effect of that?
the net effect of that is, i believe this is a fatal flaw in the
scheme as far as six a (two).
i'm only on six (a) two now.
by providing.
if you just take a situation, if you have not provided any criteria, then my
submission would have been.
this is completely void because you cannot distribute citizenship without rational, reasonable criteria.
that's the foundation as far as the constitutional logic and the constitutional.
and good governance is concerned, there must be some criteria.
to which the answer would be, but we have criteria, we have four criteria.
but when you prescribe four criteria facially, and do not couple that with a machinery
to evaluate and assess those criteria, you are in short prescribing no criteria at all
and this is now fatal, according to us, as far as six (two), is concerned.
it just can't stand.
you can't prescribe criteria, then have no machinery and therefore just start granting citizenship.
so now, what's the net effect of this?
the net effect of this is, that any person because it's fifty seven years now,
since the first of january ' sixty six.
so anyone over the age of fifty seven in assam, can claim citizenship without the
requirement of establishing ancestry or provenance.
that's the net effect.
you are just.
your carte blanche just granting citizenship because you have no machinery.
so, basically what is happening is, this is the grant of citizenship without scrutiny.
it is a criteria-less citizenship, six (two).
i'm only on six (two).
in effect, it is a criteria-less citizenship and this i don't believe parliament can do,
even though it has the legislative competence.
no action under our constitution can be so completely devoid of any rationality or any
basis.
you prescribed it.
all right.
good luck.
you prescribed it.
but then what's your machinery to determine these four points that the person has entered
assam, come from bangladesh, is of indian origin, which is defined, and is ordinarily resident
in assam. nothing at all, for the first of january ' sixty six.
so, i would respectfully therefore submit that insofar as six (two), is concerned, it ought
to go, that's all.
i can't say anything further.
it ought to go.
you can't have a system of criteria-less citizenship.
facially we've got four conditions, but there are no machinery.
that's the end of it.
so, this is now my first set of points.
my focus was on six (two).
now i move to six a (three).
sorry. what will happen then is this, that suppose somebody is detected to be a
foreigner.
yes, i'll come to that.
he is detected or she is detected to be a prima facie a case of
a foreigner.
notice is issued to that person.
yes. that person says that, look, i am protected by the deeming conferment of citizenship
by six a (two).
the onus is on that person then, to establish that these four conditions are satisfied
by them.
you have to then establish that look, we must also understand that we are dealing
with people who came in before nineteen sixty six.
that's why made this classification.
that's right.
but if notice is given to a person that look, you are claiming to be
under six a (two), but you've never come before ' sixty six, you're framing something
which you are not.
that person must show first, entry before ' sixty six or entry by an ancestor,
parent, grandparent.
two, entry from assam. three ordinarily.
let me answer that.
let me answer that.
now i'm back.
i'd move to six a (three), but now i'm going back to six a (two).
this deeming conferment to citizenship is on those people who genuinely meet that description in
six a (two).
true. it does not confer citizenship on anybody who is just in india before '
sixty six.
but now.
so, let me answer that.
now, let me just, let's focus on this and your lordship's point with regard.
may i continue after lunch?
continue after lunch.
grateful. mister divan, i was actually reflecting on what you said at lunch.
just look at this way.
when the law provides for.
i may be wrong, i'm just formulating it.
when a law provides for a deeming consequence, that consequence operates without any adjudication, or
without application of mind to the facts of a particular case.
generally. not here.
the deeming consequence, what we call a deeming fiction.
i would accept that.
right?
now, when the consequence is called into question in an individual case on the ground
that the conditions requisite for attaining that consequence are absent, your four conditions, the fact
that those four conditions were not satisfied or any of them was not satisfied, and
therefore the person is not entitled to the benefit of the deeming consequence, is always
up for adjudication.
suppose for instance, somebody, i'll tell you, somebody now prior.
a person, prior to ' sixty six applies for an indian passport.
all right?
or their child dot now comma those people will be.
now, as you said fifty seven years old, that person applies for a passport.
i mean, at least fifty seven.
the passport officer says that, look, i can't give you a passport.
you're not an indian citizen.
then at that stage, if he says, no, i'm an indian citizen by virtue of
six a (two).
i'm not saying, the passport officer will do that adjudication.
he has no power to do that adjudication.
but certainly, the validity of his status can be then decided.
suppose somebody applies for some other social welfare benefit which is available only for a
citizen.
otherwise, we can clarify that actually.
that this is not that anybody who claims that status gets the status.
so let me just answer this now.
your lordships have formulated.
so i have two - three answers straight away.
so, just look at six a (two) please.
just have a look at six a (two).
i'll just read some parts of it.
you see, subject to the provisions of six and seven, all persons of indian origin
who came before the first of january nineteen sixty six to assam from the specified
territory, including those etcetera.
who were included in the electoral roll for ' sixty seven and who have been
ordinarily resident in assam since the dates of their entry into assam shall be deemed
to be citizens of india as and from, first day of january, nineteen sixty six.
and as your lordships have seen, this provision comes onto the statute book with effect
from the seventh of december nineteen eighty five.
so it has.
the deeming is not just deeming with regard to, who becomes a citizen, but also
from when the person becomes a citizen.
that's very important.
deemed to be a citizen as from the first of january ' sixty six.
now, we're not going there, because of some rationale provided, etc, because there were elections
held.
we are not getting into any of that.
i am first examining this subsection through.
facially.
so, assume everything is what it says, what it means to say.
so four conditions your lordships have specified.
i don't want to repeat it.
now, look at the manner and the mechanics of it.
first question.
are there criteria?
i'm just asking myself.
criteria there are.
i believe there are criteria.
so, you cannot assay a provision on the ground that this is just being handed
out to anybody and everybody without criteria.
and criteria is necessary.
i believe for the grant of citizenship.
there must be some rational application of mind, some objective criteria.
now, there are objective criteria.
that's the other part.
so, not just criteria, objective criteria.
now, those objective criteria are on the basis of certain fact situations.
now, i'll take a simple one.
you have to enter into assam. that's my other point, but let's keep that aside.
not west bengal, not enter.
it has to be to assam. that's one point.
it has to be prior to january first sixty six.
it has to be from bangladesh. and you have to be thereafter resident.
now, all these elements, i'm just suggesting to the court, because what is deeming?
deeming, according to us, is a basket of rights.
according to you it has to be a machinery.
yeah, so i'll come to that.
it's a basket of rights.
citizenship is a basket of rights.
and that basket of rights includes political rights, it includes civil rights, it may include
social rights, it may include economic rights.
this is a very important concept because that will also tie into some tentative observations
made of.
does proportionality have any role in this?
and we will try and suggest some solution.
what the chief justice is is saying is this, you are right.
now, it is ultimately for the individual to have its own view of satisfaction of
these four criteria.
it is also the state.
now, merely because subsection two does not speak about it.
yeah. the question is, will that take away the power of the state government to
go into the issue and satisfy itself whether a or b has satisfied it?
so, may i answer that?
i'll answer that straight away.
my respectful submission is, and there'll be some guidance from some case law which i'll
place presently.
but there, once you specify criteria, you must, in the facts and circumstance of this
case, and having regard to the nature of this provision have a machinery to determine
those criteria.
but see, a deeming fiction is provided by the constitution itself in article seven.
the constitution itself provides for a deeming grant of citizenship in article six.
yes, yes.
there's no machinery in article six.
of course, you can't challenge an original provision of the constitution whether it is a.
see article six also says not withstanding etcetera., etcetera., shall be deemed to be a
citizen of india by commencement to the constitution.
i accept that.
so, even the constitution provision.
that's the starting provision.
someone had to be a citizen of india. so there was a cutoff date which
was prescribed and there were provisions which were made.
that's very different according to us.
but if somebody were to claim the benefit of article six citizenship.
yes. then the question as to whether he or she satisfies.
should there be a contest?
.
that can be gone into?
so may i, may i answer that by in this manner?
i accept the provision.
i accept the position that you may have certain circumstances, such as at the inception
of the constitution or at the starting of the constitution when you may not require
to have a case by case determination insofar as individuals are concerned.
however, the nature of six a (two), and i'm not putting it any higher than
that.
six a (two) by prescribing objective criteria required, according to us, a machinery to ascertain
those objective criteria in individual cases.
it can't be just as a defence mechanism and someone wants to take action against
you, that it happens.
because you're conferring a basket of rights, including political rights and the full range of
rights.
so that my lords is my respectful submission.
and according to me, our submission is that this is fatal as far as this,
because otherwise it really amounts to saying, no, i'll just flip it around.
suppose they provided no criteria.
ultimately, what is the.
that's what it means.
if you are not providing a machinery, it is a criteria less citizenship with a
date of the first of january ' sixty six because nobody is required to go
through any evaluation process at all.
that's exactly what chief justice correctly observed, that that probably happened at the inception of
the constitution, where there was a presumption that everybody who was there on or before
a particular date is deemed to be the citizen of india. so that's okay there,
but is it now okay, here is the question for your lordships to consider.
that permit system, etcetera.
has been explained to your lordships. so these my lords are my submissions, as far
as six a is concerned.
now i want to go to six a (three).
six a (three).
now on six a (three) again, first point, no time limit.
i think that's common ground.
now, if no time limit is provided for working out this section, according to us
the section itself is vulnerable and i have premised this submission on the basis that
we suggested a few expressions that the provision remains on the statute book and continues
to act as a beacon indefinitely.
it's like a magnet which attracts people to assam with all the consequences, as far
as illegal migrants are concerned.
and therefore, in our respectful submission, this itself this is a fatal element to it,
namely that there is no time limit which is prescribed within which this process is
to be completed.
it can be done tomorrow as well.
that's open ended.
and that's very, very dangerous and wrong and illegal, according to us.
so this is our next respectful submission.
now my lords, i'm focusing on another concept, and the concept which i am now
focusing on is person ordinarily resident in assam. this is under the six a (three)
challenge, right?
yes, but actually, it will span both, because that same expression is used.
but i'll just make the point.
i'll just make the point.
now, if we go to six a (one) you will find, if you just have
a look at six a (one), you will find there's a definition as far as
assam is concerned, detected to be a foreigner, specified territory, deemed to be a person,
deemed to be of indian origin and deemed to have been detected.
your lordships see that?
the expressions which are defined?
person ordinarily resident in assam is not defined.
now, this is very, very important for my purposes because this is really the entire
fulcrum on which both the sections and the sub-sections and the entire scheme operates.
and this is my primary grievance if your lordship recalls, in the opening.
this whole business of making it persons ordinarily resident in india and compelling everyone to
remain there.
that's one aspect, but now let's focus on six a (three).
now i ask myself if you have certain statutes like, say, fema, income tax act,
you have notions of residency defined or linked to the number of days, maybe one
hundred eighty two days.
it may be something more, but you have to have a clear definition.
it cannot suffer from this type of vagueness, undefined expression, key core provision of resident
in india, ordinarily resident in india, person ordinarily resident in assam. i'm sorry, what does
that mean?
is it one week?
is it five weeks?
is it six months?
is it five years?
is it two years?
no yardstick at all provided.
and this according to us cuts across both subsections.
it leaves it completely vague.
and in our respectful submission, if we are right, unconstitutionally vague.
you see the vice of extreme vagueness in a situation for a core concept such
as this, what does it leave it?
what is the guidance given to a foreigner's tribunal or anyone else?
what is ordinary?
that's a question, i ask myself.
now, in this regard, actually, in both respects machinery, absence of machinery, as well as
for vagueness, we have some guidance to be obtained from a decision of your lordships.
yes, this my lords, i'll just give you the citation very quickly.
this is judgment yes, of our constitution bench.
i'll give you the citation.
sixty nine two scc one hundred and sixty six, harakchand ratanchand banthia versus union of
india. we'll just request the court master to put it up.
sixty nine two scc one hundred and sixty six.
now, this had to do.
and the relevant paragraph, i should just indicate, is paragraph twenty one in the context
of renewal of licenses at page one.
i think it may be at page one.
para twenty one, it begins with we now come to section twenty.
yes. so i just placed this word it spans both issues and it's self-explanatory when
i read the para.
we now come to section twenty seven of the act which relates to licensing of
dealers.
it was stated on behalf of the petitioners that the conditions imposed by sub-section six
of section twenty seven for the grant or renewal of licenses are uncertain, vague and
unintelligible and consequently, wide and unfettered power was conferred upon the statutory authorities in the
matter of grant of renewal of license.
in our opinion, the contention is well founded and must be accepted as correct.
section twenty seven (six) (a) states that in the matter of issue of renewal of
license, the administrator shall have regard to the number of dealers existing in the region
in which the applicant intends to carry on business as a dealer, but the word
region is nowhere defined in the act.
similarly sections twenty seven (six) (b) requires the administrator to have regard to the anticipated
demand as estimated by him for ornaments in that region.
the expression anticipated demand is a vague expression which is not capable of objective assessment
and is bound to lead to a great deal of uncertainty.
similarly, the expression suitability of the applicant in twenty seven (six) (e) and public interest
in twenty seven (six) (g).
do not provide any objective standard or norm of guidance.
for these reasons, it must be held that clauses so and so impose unreasonable restrictions
on the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on their trade and are constitutionally
invalid.
it was also contended that, there was no reason why the condition for renewal of
license should be rigorous as the condition for initial grant of license.
the requirement of strict condition for the renewal of license renders the entire future of
the business of dealers uncertain and subjects it to caprice and arbitrary will of the
administrative authority.
there is justification for this argument and the requirement of section twenty six of the
act imposing the same conditions for the renewal of license, as for the initial grant,
appears to be unreasonable.
in our opinion, so and so are inextricably bound up with the other clauses in
section twenty seven (six) and form part of a single scheme.
the result is, that clauses so and so are not severable, and the entire section
twenty seven (six) must be held invalid.
twenty seven (two) (d) of the act states that the valid license issued by the
administrator may contain such conditions, limitations and restrictions as the administrator may think fit to
impose and different conditions, limitations or restrictions may be imposed on different classes of dealers.
on the face of it, this subsection confers such wide and vague power upon the
administrator that it is difficult to limit it's limited scope.
in our opinion, twenty seven (two) (d) of the act must be struck down as
unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on business.
it appears, however, to us that if section twenty seven (two) (d) and twenty seven
(six), etcetera.
are invalid, the licensing scheme contemplated in the rest of twenty seven cannot be worked.
it is therefore necessary for parliament to enact fresh legislation etcetera.
so, this is important in the context of vagueness, which your lordship. so this, i
think.
at least we feel that this is persuasive on the point that when you have
such key concepts which remain completely undefined and open ended, we are left guessing as
to what is the exact contour or parameter of persons who are resident, shall be
ordinarily resident in india, in assam, i'm sorry, since the dates of entry, etcetera.
so this is too crucial a concept without any parameter or anything laid out.
so, anyway, i'm done now with this point.
yes. now, this i should.
yes, your lordship may just note it that this was followed to strike down sixty
six a. i'll give you the citation.
shreya singhal versus union of india. that's, of course, a two judge bench, my lords,
twenty fifteen.
volume five, scc, page one, at paragraphs fifty five to sixty eight and eighty five,
two learned judges.
and in shayara bano versus union of india this aspect is now regarded as a
facet of manifest arbitrariness.
in justice nariman's judgment, twenty seventeen, nine scc, page one, paragraph one hundred and one.
that is my lords, at index number one hundred and sixty three of volume five,
before your lordships. shayara bano is there.
so now this.
is one aspect.
now there's one other parallel.
sorry. one other aspect which i'll just.
since we are on this machinery aspect, i'll just indicate.
we have the advantage of a constitution bench judgment, in state of madhya pradesh versus
baldeo prasad the citation is (' sixty one) one scr nine hundred and seventy.
and from the scc print, it is paragraphs eight and nine that are relevant.
okay, we'll try and get that.
it's the paragraph beginning, the section does not provide that.
yes, just above this.
your lordship has that?
now, i'll just explain this so this was in the context of the gunda act,
and the provision was struck down by the high court, upheld by the supreme court
because the definitions were just so completely vague.
now, just two paragraphs.
the section does not provide that the district magistrate must first take.
must first come to a decision that the person against whom he proposes to take
action is a gunda and gives him no guidance or assistance in the said matter.
it is true that under section four, a gunda is entitled to have an opportunity
to be heard after he is given a copy of the grounds on which the
order is proposed to be made against him.
but there is no doubt that all the gunda is entitled to show in response
to the notice is to challenge the correctness of the grounds alleged against him.
the inquiry does not contemplate an investigation into the question as to whether a person
is a gunda or not.
the position, therefore, is that the district magistrate can proceed against a person without being
required to come to a formal decision as to whether the said person is a
gunda or not, and in any event, no opportunity is intended to be given to
the person to show cause he's not a gunda.
the failure of the section to make a provision in that behalf, undoubtedly constitutes a
serious infirmity in the scheme.
so, what we are providing, what we are trying to draw sustenance in terms of
our argument is that providing a machinery for determining and not just issuing a show
cause notice to gunda, you can't.
this converse point, namely that, oh, it might be weeded out in a process when,
if and when someone is detected is not enough.
there ought to be, in our respectful submission.
i am sorry.
those who take the benefit of subsection three.
there is a machinery.
for three, there's a machinery.
there's a machinery by the explanation.
no, no, no, there's no doubt about that.
there's no machinery for subsection two.
my machinery argument is confined only to insofar as.
subsection two?
subsection two is concerned, and also to the extent that if you haven't defined a
person who is ordinarily resident in assam. i mean, then what are the inquiry going
to be.
it's just completely vague.
what machinery can.
what can the machinery do also?
this is such a crucial concept.
it has to be some days, some numbers.
something has to be there.
ordinary resident it, just otherwise completely.
you have artificial definitions for fiscal legislation like income tax.
one hundred and eighty days.
yes, you are right.
for fema, you know whatever, two hundred and seventy days.
but these are not, in that sense, fiscal enactments.
for the fiscal enactments, it normally will have a very precise definition.
yeah. you're conferring citizenship.
so, ordinary resident is not a term of art.
it has the ordinary connotation, somebody who.
for how many days, i ask myself.
it won't be for ordinary residents for two days, or ordinary residents for three days.
but what if it is for six months?
yeah, there is no precise definition.
frankly, my lord, the law is actually to the contrary.
if you with an intention move.
so for example, someone like me sort of moved cities and came to delhi. if
a person moves to delhi, and even on day five, if i've intended to move
to delhi, i would then probably have to describe myself as resident if i pack
my bag, etcetera.
on day two.
intention to reside.
yes, but here, therefore, you have a situation.
my lord, please.
this is in the context of illegal migrants, it's not an ordinary person translocating within
the country, etcetera.
and so, having regard to that factual matrix, absent any criteria, any guidance, i believe
it is constitutionally informed in terms of an absence of any definition.
now my lord i am now done with this particular aspect as well.
now i go to my next point.
now here i wish to draw support from the joint communiqué.
so i'll just state the point.
first, the point is this, the point is neither the.
sorry, one more point, my lords in that notion of ordinarily resident in assam. i
just make that point and then i'll move to the next one.
this is not a concept which we found embedded anywhere, either in the assam accord
or indeed in the communiqué.
i'll just state that point.
so that has no basis at all.
that's a creation and a construct.
there's no historical basis.
there is no commitment in terms of international obligations or anything like that as far
as this notion of ordinarily resident in assam is concerned.
now, my lords, i'm not on the communiqué.
now would your lordships, please.
sorry. yes, your lordships will find that at serial number four-a page nine thousand three
hundred and ninety eight and it's at serial number ninety four.
volume?
four-a. so i'll just state my points quickly on this communiqué.
volume four-a, page ninety four?
no, no, the page is nine thousand three hundred and ninety eight.
page nine thousand three hundred and ninety eight of volume four-a. yes. so i have
two points here.
your lordships have the communiqué?
yes. so if you have page nine thousand three hundred and ninety eight, if you
just see the second paragraph of the communiqué starting with the words during his stay.
during his stay, the prime minister of bangladesh addressed a mammoth gathering of people of
calcutta. he expressed gratitude on behalf of the government and people of bangladesh, to the
government and people of india especially to the neighbouring states of west bengal, tripura, meghalaya,
and assam for the hospitality and assistance given to the millions of bangladesh citizens and
for the moral and material support given by the government and the people of india
to the struggle for liberation.
and then your lordships will see a further reference to that day, the twenty fifth
of march nineteen seventy one that's towards the foot.
the prime minister of bangladesh solemnly reaffirmed his resolve to ensure by every means the
return of all the refugees who have taken shelter in india since the twenty fifth
of march nineteen seventy one and to strive etcetera., etcetera.
so i make two points.
the first point i wish to make is this is not specific to assam. now,
let's be very clear on that.
this communiqué doesn't single out assam at all.
and i make a second point, which is, in fact the communiqué treats the neighbouring
states of west bengal, tripura, meghalaya and assam as a single set of bordering states
for which the prime minister of bangladesh also accords his great thanks and extends his
thanks to the people of these states.
so i believe this supports our submissions in two respects.
first, this is no justification for singling out assam, and second in terms of what
was recognized as the impact even then was all these border states, and therefore this
amounts to invidious discrimination, and it amounts to an object which is itself, by its
very nature, discriminatory.
now i want to just, there are several other points, but i'm just going point
wise.
but i want to just leave a thought with you, and then i'll come back
to it.
please consider if you, if you consider it appropriate, and i'll deal with this in
the context other submissions.
i'll just state the point and then cite the decision later.
i believe this provision ought to be struck down entirely.
that's my case.
but please contemplate a prospective invalidation.
think about.
i mean, think.
i'm sure your lordships will think about it, the moment we make our submission in
that regard.
but i'm just planting the seed at this point of time.
look this is, it was mentioned correctly by, well, i don't know what correctly, but
the solicitor general, at least at one point reacted to the observations made by the
bench. i'm just saying it was a reaction.
maybe this is in the nature of a transitory provision, etcetera., but.
i'm not holding anyone to that particular expression.
but surely when you have no time, which is prescribed at all for when you
can take advantage of this and if it were for some historic purpose, from '
sixty six to ' seventy one, surely it should not continue on the statute book
and become a license and become an opportunity of fertile ground for all sorts of
local industries with regard to documentation and things of that sort and remain on the
statute book and remain on an endless beacon only to the state of assam. so,
anyway, i just made that point with regard to.
so i now come to my next submission.
it really builds on the point regarding the communiqué.
territorial classifications we accept are valid classifications.
that is a valid method for the legislature to certainly go about its job.
we don't question that at all.
the issue is, is it a valid classification here when the problem was for all
the border states.
when the communiqué recognized all the border states, when the affidavits, which have been filed
by the union government, also record and their submissions record and accept that this is
a huge problem in other states as well, which are just our neighbours.
then the question i ask myself is surely this is a case of impermissible and
a discriminatory object of itself singling out assam for this.
and when it is combined with the notion of ordinarily resident in assam and continues
to be ordinarily resident in assam, it has impacts across generations and across decades.
now, i come to the next point.
so, i won't take you there.
but the solicitor general correctly went through his written submissions and he pointed out six
sets of provisions in our constitution itself, which are specific to assam. so, i'll just
comment on them because that was a point which was raised.
the provisions which are special to assam in our constitution are in this regard.
first, with regard to autonomy and greater autonomy to certain areas including sixth schedule, one.
that's one type.
second, it is with respect to grants being made by the central government in lieu
of export duty on jute.
so again, it's something beneficial.
third, it's in respect of general grants in aid to assam, because there are parts
of the country which are found to be necessitating or requiring a leg up.
fourth, there are special provisions by the gst council for assam and a number of
other enumerated states.
there are six or seven states, which, the solicitor general fairly placed before you.
so it's a group of states where it was felt that the gst council, etcetera.,
has to have special regard with regard to assam. then it's with respect to provisions
for reservations of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. and the other special provision is for
tribal administration.
so, broadly these are special provisions inuring to the benefit of the citizenry of assam,
the people of assam and the state of assam. they are not provisions where you
set out one territory and then discriminate in it.
when i say discriminate, what i mean is, your lordships have followed.
i mean, i'm not saying there were some animus against the state of assam. not
that way.
what we are suggesting to the court is by singling assam out and then coupling
it with ordinarily resident for all times, i mean, it's really a death blow or
it's terrible as far as the demographic and future impacts are concerned.
so territorial classification we accept.
all the examples given are beneficial for advantages for certain social goods and uplift.
i don't believe the present statute fulfils any of those requirements insofar as the citizens
of assam are concerned.
now we have no.
yes, i would respectfully submit there is no instance of any, what i would describe
as hostile discrimination.
these are all beneficent classifications for assam. there is no case as at least as
which we could find or no situation where assam has been singled out for the
purposes of something harsh or something which is disadvantageous.
i'll say disadvantageous.
now i come to the next point.
and the next point is really in terms of now the reality is that this
six a is only with respect to assam, so i'm.
just stating the point.
i believe this by itself and nothing further requires heightened scrutiny or strict scrutiny, and
not the relaxed scrutiny standard, which was commended by the attorney general. i will just
put it at that.
now, please.
sorry. now, i'm on my next point.
now here, please consider as an alternative submission on our part, an appropriate declaration.
strictly in the alternative, from my standpoint, a declaration that the impugned provision section six
a be declared prospectively to be invalid and here i'll just give you the citation,
the judgment that we are relying upon is somaiya organics. (two thousand one), volume five,
scc, five nineteen.
the relevant paragraphs are twenty three to twenty seven.
sorry, my mistake.
twenty three to thirty seven.
i will just read thirty seven your lordships. if it's there, well and good otherwise
dot three seven.
okay, yes.
nevertheless, a enacted law without legislative competence remains on the statute book till a code
of competent adjudicates or declares it to be void.
when the court declares it to be void, only then it is known as for
all purposes.
in synthetics and chemicals, invalidity of provisions was declaration under article one hundred and forty
one of the constitution.
it was for the doing complete justice that the court in exercise of the jurisdiction
under article one hundred and forty two moulded the relief in such a way that
as to give effect to the declaration prospectively.
it's not possible to accept that such an order of prospective overruling is contrary to
law and invalid law has to be, has not been held to be valid.
all that has happened is declaration of invalidity of the legislation was directed to take
effect from a future date.
so this might be.
i mean just if we are wrong with respect to our primary submission.
but you feel, or rather if we are right on our primary submission but your
lordships feel still there are some moulding which is required to be done, then you
may consider this.
but according to us it is really unfair to have this continuing on the statute
book because it's not just a one-time issue.
it's an abiding impact which continues across generations.
now i come to my next point, because i understood a submission to be made
that with regard to culture, there has been no explanation in either the pleadings or
in any of our documents as to what it is, etcetera.
so i'm just giving you the paragraph numbers and the page numbers and i'll just
summarize our case.
in writ petition eight hundred and seventy six of twenty fourteen which your lordships will
find at volume three.
the volume three, the averments as far as culture are concerned, in great detail are
from paragraphs twenty one to thirty four of the petition and it's at pages three
thousand ten to three thousand twenty.
so we've given definitions of culture, international obligations for present.
sorry. yes, yes, for six a (two).
yes, it does.
yeah, right. no, but i dot can i just tell you at this distance so.
may i just respond to that?
so i'll just resort to that.
the question being put dot sorry. persons who would have not have been included but
still it will open to them to contend that we were there before ' sixty
six, but actually it was so i know.
that the question to, as i understand it, is that is it too late in
the day to provide a machinery insofar as six a (two) is concerned.
that's one, i think.
one part of the question.
in my respectful submission at this distance of time, this is thirty seven, thirty eight
years after nineteen eighty five.
that's why we waited to see how are they going to place their case as
far as machinery, etcetera.
is concerned.
but nobody even suggests that there's a machinery under six a (two).
actually, there's a little bit of a policy determination by parliament. i think what parliament
seems to have done was that they say prior to nineteen sixty six, they gave
a very liberalized regime for deeming citizenship.
after ' sixty six.
it's the same four criteria.
you're right and the same criteria but with the addition for ' sixty six to
' seventy one for registration.
that's included my lord. please see that my lord. there's no registration requirement for prior
to ' sixty six.
sorry. haan, haan, registration required.
registration and therefore, for those who came in between ' sixty six to ' seventy
one, they had one specific criterion, namely that you must have been detected as a
foreigner.
that is, actually.
it's like an amnesty that first you had detected as a foreigner.
if you are not detected as a foreigner, you don't get the benefit.
after you have been detected as a foreigner you have to then register.
if you are registered, then you get citizenship.
that's the scheme.
for ' sixty six to ' seventy one.
actually, that is how we understand it.
that's right.
because it was suggested just to add to that we didn't find any method by
which you can make a self-declaration.
you have to be detected.
it has to be detected.
now, prior to ' sixty six, i think there seems to be some sort of
a more relaxed regime, which was applied by parliament. what does it mean?
on the basis that these were things which happened in the past they are not
going to go out of india. we don't want them to be stateless.
they have assimilated, for all intents and purposes, because prior to ' sixty six means
that nineteen years had elapsed even when the law was brought into force, parliament felt
that all right now what has happened in the past, let's now freeze it at
that.
my lord, i would respectfully submit that would be.
so just responding to the point, i would be a little more generous to parliament
in the sense, i would suggest that parliament is certainly providing criteria which are objective.
so, what i'm suggesting to the court is that i believe it would be correct
to interpret the statute as saying that parliament intended exactly what it mentioned.
it didn't want to just hand over citizenship's, x, y,z.
there are those conditions even there.
there are criteria which are there.
now, if you have criteria which are there, there ought to be a machinery.
so what your lordship is saying, there's not even a census.
it's not even after this act comes into force that there is a count, at
least we are freezing everybody on this day.
not even that.
there will be a machinery under the foreigners' order.
no. there's nothing happened after nineteen eighty five.
it's just, we specify so that nobody can really object and say it's criteria less,
and then we have no machinery, so it becomes criteria less, and then there's a
distance of time, so therefore, an argument is advanced or delay, so i think we
should.
now i'm just making the point.
so now on culture, i was on that aspect.
i've given you the pages where we have detailed, we've cited various international covenants, etcetera.,
with regard to the protection of culture.
and based on the census report because the studies which we placed in our opening
were based on the census figures.
so four impacts, language, religion, land holding, and number four, self-governance.
because if you are taking away, it's a right according to our self-governance.
organizing yourself in a community is all a very, very important aspect of culture.
and what is happening here is there is an enormous undermining of the local community
by, i will use the expression non-citizens.
so that's the cultural impact which we have, which we believe we have been able
to satisfactorily project.
none of this has been contested at all.
now, i come on to the point.
next point which is with regard to proportionality and the basket of rights.
now citizenship as we understand it, as i indicated that earlier is a full-fledged basket
of rights recognized under the constitution, recognized under statutes.
one can understand.
there are subordinate rights.
those subordinate rights might involve an exclusion of political rights, it might involve an exclusion
of certain economic rights.
may. what is that point?
subordination?
sorry?
what is the last.
the second point?
so i'm just suggesting to the court that you have a full basket of, right?
yes, that's one.
that's citizenship.
but there can be situations.
so, for example, let me just give you an example.
international humanitarian law requires, there are minimum standards under international humanitarian law. you have to
provide that.
but that is short insofar as, of citizenship.
so, the proportionate response which would be in a situation such as this, if people
have come from nineteen sixty six or earlier than ' sixty six, or because of
certain situations and exigencies such as facing deprivation or facing much more hostile circumstances, then
certain minimum international human rights, humanitarian law standards can certainly and ought to be extended.
but that is short of citizenship.
and therefore, in our respectful submission, six a fails to narrowly tailor benefits to non-citizens.
it is completely disproportionate in what it grants and gives without any meaningful scrutiny.
and so the expression used live and let live is perhaps consistent with international humanitarian
law in the context of illegal migrants, but there is no requirement of conferring citizenship.
that is something much higher and this provision in doing so, perhaps exceeds permissible limits.
now, i go to my next point.
so i will just come to 'statelessness'.
but just have a look at one provision, which was read, which is the foreigners
act. sorry, my lord, there are two sections i want to read.
first, please just have a look at the foreigners act, section three.
it is at page three hundred and eighty six of volume four, serial number six.
there are just two statutes i want to touch on.
your lordships have the foreigners act, nineteen forty six?
because this was a question.
mister divan, page is?
volume three, page?
three hundred and eighty six, volume four, volume four, three hundred and eighty six.
so i'm going to just read the section.
so your lordships will see, what can the central government do.
or what is it required to do elsewhere in the country.
your lordships have foreigners act, nineteen forty six?
yes. so, if we see section three, directly, i'll just read this.
three (one) power to make orders.
the central government may, by order, make provision either generally or in respect to all
foreigners, or with respect to any particular foreigner or any prescribed class or description of
foreigner for prohibiting, regulating or restricting the entry of foreigners into india or their departure
therefrom, or the presence of continued presence or continued presence therein.
in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, orders may be
made under this section that may provide to the foreigner: a).
shall not enter india, or shall not, or shall enter india only at such times
and by such routes.
b), shall not depart from india or shall depart only at such time and by
such route from such port.
shall not remain in india or in any prescribed areas wherein.
shall, if he has been required by order under this section not to remain in
india, meet from any resources at his disposal, the cost of removal from india. d),
shall remove himself to and remain in such area in india as may be prescribed.
shall comply with the conditions as may be prescribed or specified, requiring him to reside
in a particular place, imposing any restrictions on his movement, requiring him to furnish such
proof of his identity and to report to such particulars, to such authority, requiring him
to allow his photograph and finger impressions to be taken, requiring him to submit himself
to such medical examination, prohibiting him from association with persons, prohibiting him from engaging in
activities of a prescribed or specified description, prohibiting him from using or possessing described or
specified articles otherwise regulating the conduct in any particulars as may be prescribed, shall enter
into a bond, etcetera., shall be arrested and detained or confined and may make provisions
for any matter which is or may be prescribed and for such incidental and supplementary
matters.
so very wide.
now, this is the regime which applies across india for foreigners.
this is their power, which they have and please see subsection three.
any. of three.
any authority prescribed in this behalf may, with respect to any particular foreigner, make orders
under clauses (e), (f) of subsection two, which, as your lordships have seen, includes the
removal requiring a person to reside in a particular place, etcetera.
and to enter into a bond, etcetera.
so now this is the national regime.
so they have these powers.
and i think the purpose of this section is also to draw the distinction between
citizens on the one hand and foreigners on the other hand.
so there's a complete, there's a divide and there is a huge gap, therefore, in
meeting up, in lifting up to a citizen.
now, please see the other provision, which was read to your lordships is the immigrants
expulsion from assam act, nineteen fifty.
now, look at this statute.
it's at page four hundred and twenty four of volume four, and it's at serial
number ten.
same volume.
expulsions from assam? nineteen fifty.
the immigrants expulsion from assam act nineteen fifty, which was placed in court.
page?
what page would that be? four hundred and twenty four.
volume four, page four hundred and twenty four.
now see the parliamentary mandate here.
an act to provide for the expulsion of certain immigrants from assam be enacted by
parliament. short title.
the act may be called the immigrants expulsion from assam act, nineteen fifty.
it extends to the whole of india. power to order expulsion of certain immigrants.
if the central government is of the opinion that any person or class of persons
having been ordinarily, ordinarily resident in any place outside india has or have, whether before
or after the commencement of this act come into assam and that the stay of
such person or class of persons in assam is detrimental to the interests of the
general public of india or any section thereof, or any scheduled tribe in assam, the
central government may, by order, a) direct such person or class of persons to remove
himself or themselves from india or assam within such time and by such routes as
may be specified, give such further directions in this regard to his removal, or the
removal from india or assam, as it may consider necessary or expedient.
and then the proviso.
provided that nothing in this section shall apply to any person who, on account of
civil disturbance or fear of such disturbance in any area now forming part of pakistan
has been displaced from or has left his place of residence in such area and
has been subsequently residing in assam. so i'll just make two or three submissions.
first where the expression in section two is the central government may, by order, direct
the person to remove himself, we would respectfully submit this is a power coupled with
duty.
that's one point i want to make.
so the whole emphasis is that you have a parliamentary statute which is extant for
expulsion of people from here and on the same hand.
how do you balance that with section six a and this open ended no time
limit provision, which continues to act as a beacon?
so, the two really don't stay or can't really sit side by side.
and here, if you are correct that this is the act which really should be
worked, and its main purpose is expulsion, then i would respectfully submit that as far
as the proviso is concerned it has to be given its plain meaning.
but it's a narrow exception to the general rule.
it's a narrow exception insofar as the general rule is concerned.
yes, and this again, there's no question, of course, here of conferral of any citizenship.
now, my lord i just want to point out one part with regard to one
other element and this is in our writ petition.
i'll just give you the page number.
it is page three thousand and forty four, volume three.
now, i am just mentioning this because it came up in the course of your
lordship's observations, etcetera.
there's an extract here from doctor namrata goswami was an associate fellow at the institute
of defence studies and analysis, new delhi and she has written a paper or a
study and there is a quotation here which is important from a facet which your
lordships raised, which is economics.
because the state has limited economic resources and what is happening as a result of
illegal migrants is that there are manifold economic impacts, which are recognized here.
so, the labour rates, etcetera., go down, and the result is that local people don't
get as much of a living as they might otherwise.
then there are beneficent schemes which the government of india rolls out.
and those resources also get drawn up by persons who ordinarily would not be entitled
to it.
now, my lords, i go to my next point and the next point is with
respect to, with respect to this notion of statelessness.
now, i'll just make three or four points on statelessness.
oh, sorry.
the whole document is also available.
my lord, that issue, statelessness doesn't arise here, it arises in somewhere else.
they have argued on statelessness, and that is has real dot your lordships. that i
want.
anyway, i want to just address your lordships on statelessness.
i'll just make four points or five points.
first point.
there are there other petitions pending on this my lord. therefore, i am cautioning my
learned friend as a good friend that, let him not touch this issue.
nobody has raised.
it's a concern which your lordship, the argument made is that if you strike down
six a, it will result in statelessness.
i'm only meeting that argument and nothing further.
i'm not going beyond that.
the argument of the respondents was that please don't strike down section six-a. that's how
i understood the argument.
we will be rendered stateless and then be.
so i'm just answering that.
first point, this argument of statelessness is completely unjustified.
and the reason we say so is because number one, what is the regime which
applies across the country other than assam, is the question i ask myself.
the very same regime which applies across the country doesn't result in statelessness, will apply
to assam. if we are correct and this provision is struck down that's number one.
number two, nobody is asking for consequential reliefs in some summary manner.
we are only seeking today a suitable and appropriate declaration of the law.
the declaration of the law will not result in by itself.
it will just state what the correct, it will clarify the correct position in law.
what consequential provisions are to be action is to be taken, will follow from that
once we have the advantage of your lordship's ruling.
but to hold up statelessness and say that goes everything.
i don't believe that.
that is that there is any justification at all for that.
now, this takes me to the latest affidavit they have find.
now, please just go to that affidavit.
the new affidavit.
please go to page two, paragraph four, i'll just focus on a couple of paragraphs.
sorry. your lordships have the affidavit?
yes. so you may just consider on the seventh of december order i think in
clause i perhaps it should be six a (three).
if you find that as an error, then that just may be.
mister divan, after this affidavit.
you'll wrap up because then can you.
yes, i'm wrapping up.
so, i'll just make two points over or three points.
so that's correction if you want.
now just see para four.
that with reference to query one, namely the number of persons to whom citizenship has
been granted under the proviso to six a, i think it should be three, namely
persons who came to assam between ' sixty six and ' seventy one.
it's humbly submitted, seventeen thousand eight hundred and sixty one, your lordship has that figure.
and the next figure is, which is that the foreigners that, with reference to the
query how many persons have been detected to be foreigners by an order of foreigners
tribunal under the foreigners so and so.
order sixty four between ' sixty six and ' seventy one.
the answer is thirty two thousand three hundred and eighty one.
so the first issue, which i'm just stating the point.
is, what happened with regard to thirty two thousand three hundred and eighty one less
seventeen thousand eight hundred and sixty one?
so, that works out to fourteen thousand five hundred and twenty persons.
so they must inform the court as to what is the action which has been
taken in respect of these fourteen thousand five hundred and twenty persons?
because these people are found not even not to be entitled to any right, even
under six a (three).
so, i would respectfully submit.
so this is one important point which your lordships will consider.
what is the action taken with regard to that?
and then please see six a (a).
sorry, para six a. illegal migrants enter into the country without valid travel documents in
a clandestine and surreptitious manner.
the detection, detention and deportation of such illegally staying foreign nationals is complex and ongoing
process.
so when your lordships ask them for the estimated flow, this was the answer.
now, the bottom line is, there is no authentic information with regard to when the
nineteen eighty five act came.
who is going to benefit or how many are going to benefit under six a
(two)?
there is no authentic figure, even in respect of six a (three), because it is
open ended, in terms of time.
and we would respectfully submit that insofar as the notion of statelessness is concerned, it
is just being raised without, because we ourselves say that as far as international humanitarian
law is concerned, and that proportionate response is concerned, that's the obligation of the state.
we are not for a moment seeking to prejudice anyone in that behalf.
now, i'm on my last point.
and the last point is with regard to delay and laches.
now, i'll just very, very briefly tell your lordships, three or four issues.
first, you will find the reference order itself has gone into this issue inter partes.
that's one.
and i said that we are entertaining this petition.
so it's inter partes, between the same parties, that a determination has been made by
this court, so we're not sitting in appeal over that judgment in the very same
case.
so that should bind.
but the reference court left it open to your lordships, to mould the relief appropriately.
so that's my first point.
my second respectful point is that, if they accept, as they do, that this provision
continues to operate.
and even tomorrow you can go and apply under six a (two) and six a
(three), then in our respectful submission, there's no question of delay and laches because it's
continuing in every respect.
my third respectful submission is that, you have a situation now which is the aspect
regarding culture, community, economic rights, which extends generation upon generation.
so it serves and deserves to be struck down, if you are correct.
even today to protect what is left, despite this huge onslaught on our cultural and
community rights.
i'm very grateful.
thank you.
thank you, mister divan. my lord, the first point i would like to deal with
is regarding the delay, my lord. on the point of delay, my lord, as my
learned friend, mister divan has pointed out, in para thirty one of the referral judgment,
virtually this point has been rejected.
and i'm sure this is not an.
lordship is not sitting in appeal over the reference court's order.
therefore, my lord, as far as the issue of delay is concerned, that stands at
rest.
yes, the reference code did frame one issue, in view of the fact, that these
beneficiaries have enjoyed certain rights over a long period of time.
therefore, one view this honourable court should take at this stage.
in other words, my lord, it is more in the realm of moulding of relief
than to non-sue the petitioners as the other side would like to contend.
therefore my lord, in my written argument, i think at page twenty nine.
i have dealt with this issue in details, my lord in detail.
i will indicate which are the pages.
that's alright that you've told us.
well, we will find it.
now summarize what you want to say.
yes, kindly give me fifteen minutes time my lord. page twenty nine to thirty two
of my written argument of volume one.
now, the government's affidavit which they have filed, government is trying to give an impression
that what we are agitating is a trivial issue.
it's a matter of thirty thousand business.
what is grave in it?
with all respect, i'll submit, is it the case of the government, they are constraint
this litigation to be an adversarial litigation where millions of immigrants are in the state,
where the local people have been outnumbered and government would still like to go by
legalism?
with great respect, this connect cannot be the correct position.
yes, it is a fact.
it is very difficult to make approximation as to what is the exact extent of
immigration which has taken place.
that's very difficult.
the white paper published by the government of assam also expressed the same difficulty.
but my lord, there are contemporaneous facts from which one can come to the conclusion
that this immigration is of substantial and my lord it has caused change of demographic
profile and other adverse effects.
so first, my lord, i would like to place for your lordships' kind consideration in
the rejoinder submission, i have volume one-a. if your lordships will kindly come to page
number three.
why don't you do this like mister divan had formulated.
no, i have formulated.
fourteen submissions of mister divan. now, you just formulate points and then tell us what
they are.
because we are now in rejoinder.
no, i know, my lord, what i'm trying to say first is while opening also,
i couldn't get much of time.
delay. you have said that the reference judgment, para thirty one, volume one, pages twenty
nine to thirty.
i have dealt with that issue.
alright. now what is the second submission?
my second submission is i'm trying to, my lord, take a stand against the affidavit
filed by the government.
so, tell us the submission.
formulate it now.
now. submission formulated, my lord. the extent of immigration is much more than thirty two
thousand.
the figure which has been reflected in the affidavit.
so in this regard my lord. but that really doesn't affect the validity of section
six a. what i'm saying.
assuming that the immigration is not thirty two thousand but three, twenty thousand or thirty
two lakhs.
the number of persons who are granted citizenship doesn't vary.
it has a bearing according to us, subject to what your lordships may say.
i'm coming to that.
i'll come to the parliament's plenary power also my lord. what are the limitations of
that?
extent of immigration is more than thirty two thousand three hundred and eighty one.
no, much more.
it is much, much more.
all right.
what is the next?
no, my lord. i'll like to place two paragraphs.
kindly permit me at page three of my volume one-a. volume one?
volume one-a of the rejoinder submission my lord. it is second sub-para two.
page?
page three.
so what is the point you make?
the point i'm trying to make is the law commission in its one hundred seventy
fifth report on amendment of the citizenship bill two thousand said that the immigration is
of such an extent that it has the potential of disturbing the unity and integrity
of the country.
it poses serious security threat to our democracy.
are you saying that the number of persons who were granted citizenship under section six
a is more than seventeen thousand?
millions, my lord. it will be more than millions.
how can that be?
you are confusing, conflating persons who are illegal immigrants with those who have been granted
the benefit of citizenship between ' sixty six and ' seventy one.
no. regarding the first batch of from up to january first sixty six.
then there's a second batch where only they would be, my lord disenfranchised for ten
years after they follow the procedure.
that's the position.
and my lord, after the twenty fifth of march seventy one, these people are to
be deported in accordance with law.
that is what the my lord accord is all about.
and that is what section six says all about.
now, my lord, by conferring citizenship to this stream of people, my lord. the first
batch?
yes, my lord. security of our country has been endangered.
that is what law commission says.
that is what my lord, the group of ministers also say.
i'm trying to rely on those reports of the government of india. so my lord,
law commission clearly says, law commission noted that entry of illegal.
if your lordships will kindly.
you said, it says that there's a potential to disturb the integrity and security of
india. what is the next point?
yes and that was an aspect which was taken note of at the next point
is, my lord after the kargil war the then prime minister of india constituted a
committee or a group of ministers. that's not a point.
that's material.
what is the point which you are making?
the point which i'm trying to make is my lord, the recommendation or the report
of the committee reveals that there are, my lord, twelve million foreigners in north-eastern india
and the report reads like this, my lord. where is the report?
at page three of volume one-a. the report is at, the report is at my
lord page three to.
mister choudhry and mister hansaria we are not going to extend hearing beyond four o'clock
today?
yes, my lord. today we close, whoever not finished or whoever has finished.
there's a guillotine at four o'clock.
no this will not spill over to tomorrow because we have another cb tomorrow.
you've got about thirty four minutes between the two of you.
please ration time and.
we'll share amongst us.
no, no, the last batsman can hit the first ball six, you see.
the others are scared of getting out so they don't try to hit a first
ball six.
the last batsman knows that he can hit a six and there's nothing to lose.
the run required is forty five, and only two overs is remaining, it's a difficult
task.
anyway my lord report is at page three thousand two hundred and forty two -
three thousand three hundred and fifty one of volume four.
three thousand two hundred and forty two?
to three thousand three hundred and fifty one of volume four.
all right.
it was headed by the then home minister of the country, my lord and the
relevant report, which i would like to read, is para two point three five at
three thousand two hundred fifty four.
para? two point three five at page three thousand two hundred and fifty four, two
point three five page three thousand two hundred and fifty four.
all right.
and just a small paragraph.
just tell us what it said.
don't read out.
just tell us.
make the point.
it says there are estimated to be about twelve million foreigners in north-east.
a host of problem has been created, including my lord economic, political, communal tensions, ethnic
clashes and one very significant observation regarding assam was my lord. thirty two percent of
the constituencies in assam are dominated by this illegal immigrants.
that means out of one hundred and fifty six, forty six.
their vote is decisive in forty six.
one hundred and twenty six constituencies no?
out of one hundred and twenty six, my lord, thirty two, makes it forty point
something.
so, it's forty.
so, therefore, my lord in my humble submission figures do matter.
all right, what's the next point?
yes. my friend, mister sibal has mostly covered, the points my lord. therefore i will
not repeat.
i would like to emphasize on a particular point, my lord. yes. what is the
scope of parliament's plenary power.
are we to understand it admits of no limitations.
just formulate it so that we can get it.
the formulation is, my lord, the power, plenary power of the parliament, its scope and
limitations.
according to you, the plenary power of parliament is subject to limitation.
yes, my lord. of course it is.
yes. now, my lord, from the facts which i've referred just now, what emanates according
to us, my lord, subject to what your lordships may say, that making of this
classification and creating this class of deemed citizens is posing security threat to this country.
that you have already said.
yes. therefore my lord, as per the decision of the honourable supreme court in indira
nehru case, my lords, versus raj narain, where honourable supreme court says that amongst others,
supremacy of the constitution, and unity and integrity of the country are also basic features
of the constitution. all right.
now, if granting of or conferring deemed citizenship to this class of persons, my lord,
it poses security threat, is the object of the legislation not unlawful?
therefore, would the parliament's power be not fettered by the constitutional innovation of violation of
doctrine of basic feature?
yes. therefore. yes, mister choudhury. my lord, in rc poudyal case.
formulation. what is the formulation?
now the formulation is my lord, classification has resulted in creation of a class of
citizen, who pose security threat, which in turn would impair the nation's unity and integrity.
that point you have already made.
now here my lord, i would like to refer on the judgment of the supreme
court, or this honourable court, in rc poudyal's case, my lord. in rc poudyal 's
case, my lord, the question which arose was.
bhutia-lepcha. yes, what is the non obstante clause?
though they have twenty percent of the population, they have reservation of thirty eight percent
of the seats in assam. and one of them.
one person- one vote.
that principle was also my lord done away with.
that was rejected by chief justice venkatachalliah's judgement.
yes, my lord. no, what i'm trying to say is, i'm relying on paragraph one
hundred and two, one hundred and seventy five and one hundred and seventy six.
one hundred and two, is by majority, my lord, and one hundred and seventy six
by honourable justice agrawal, my lord. now, what i'm trying to submit for lordship's kind
consideration is, the meaning of that non obstante clause was laid down.
now issue as whether, in view of the non obstante clause, while exercising power under
clause f, they can undo the constitutional inhibition.
there this honourable court said that, no. yes, the non obstante clause would permit you
to undo some of the constitutional provisions, but if it goes to the extent of
overreaching or overriding the basic feature theory, then it will be backed.
now what i am trying to.
the support which i seek to draw from this judgment is, my lord, by conferring
citizenship right.
yes. to this section of deemed citizens, my lord, the security and integrity of the
country has been endangered.
therefore. you have made this point three times.
therefore the object, therefore the object of the legislation is something which cannot be countenanced.
thank you mister choudhury. just one more point.
at three eighteen, you said fifteen minutes.
it's now three thirty four.
do you've got one minute?
now almost three thirty five now.
all right.
finally, my lord. i'll just add one more point.
government of india very candidly says, that as far as the allegations we have brought
out in the writ petition or the averments which are made in the petition regarding
the adverse effect of illegal immigration, they accept it.
now, is it not the government of india to do something?
what have they done?
while opening my argument, i made a submission based on article three hundred and fifty
five that it is the duty of the central government to protect the interest of
the indigenous people of the state.
now your lordships would recollect, while upholding of armed forces special power act, this honourable
court had taken the view that article three hundred fifty five enables fending of an
statute like armed forces special power act where a non- commission officer, even a junior
commission officer can, without warrant, even act in case, even in case of a non.
according to you government has not done anything other than it accepts the impact of
illegal immigrants.
yes, therefore they can't accept the thing and at the same time, not do anything
and on the contrary coming up with this figures to show as if it's a
trivial issue.
it's not a trivial issue.
it's a very serious matter.
finally, my lord, i'll make one submission for your lordships kind consideration, but in the
event.
actually, they have not said that illegal migration is immigration is a trivial issue.
they are, in fact, saying it is a very serious issue but they say that
we can't give you an estimate.
it is so large and it's impossible to give you an estimate because they are
all people who have clandestinely and surreptitiously in india. if that is the position.
absolutely correct my lord. there is no difficulty.
they are right also because they are not disputing the fact that it's a very
serious problem.
yes. and lordships, as i have already submitted, lordship will also consider the aspect.
nor are, we for a moment, even say, suggesting it is not a serious problem.
undoubtedly it is.
in that case they ought to come up with a more stringent law as to
how to deal with these foreigners instead of conferring them citizenship my lord. it's an
unheard of concept anywhere in the world where my lord's own citizens are at the
risk of losing their identity.
they are protecting the foreigners.
don't protect.
that point you have already made.
finally, my lord, having regard to the lapse of time, the numbers.
we all appreciate the practical difficulties.
in the event your lordship is inclined to take their view, that will not strike
down six a, there my submission would be, my lord, let the post the nineteenth
of july forty eight stream of people be identified and let them be relocated in
these different states on pro rata basis.
why assam alone should absorb this disproportionate bodies?
even if section six a is not struck down then post nineteen?
seven - forty eight nineteen seventy one.
yes, stream of people should be identified by undertaking an exercise like nrc and relocate
them to different states on pro rata basis across the country.
if there is a humanitarian angle, if there is an article twenty one obligation, certainly
these measures can be certainly adopted by the state.
why?
assam is a very small state.
the land mass is also very less compared to other big states.
we will consider that.
so therefore, why not they should also on pro rata basis they should be relocated
in the other parts of east.
yes, mister hansaria. deeply obliged.
let me start with the disadvantage being the last batsman, my lord. before i formulate
my lord. my lord, the chief justice asked a very pertinent question to mister divan
when he was arguing clause two deemed section.
lordship said constitution also provides article six, a deemed provision section six a (two), clause
two, says my lord deemed before one - one - nineteen sixty six.
no exercise is necessary.
my lord the chief justice said there is a constitution also provided deemed fiction under
article six.
would your lordship also kindly see article six for a minute?
it has limitations my lord. if your lordships see article six a. my lord article
six (b)(two) which gives citizenship to the persons who have migrated after the nineteenth of
july ' forty eight.
there are four criteria because my lord here also they are giving citizenship to the
persons who have come after the nineteenth of july ' forty eight.
they have to be registered as a citizen.
they have to make an application.
they have to make that application before the commencement of the constitution, before the twenty
sixth of january nineteen fifty, and they have to be in india six months before.
none of these conditions are there in clause two of six a. it's open ended.
as mister divan has said, it's open-ended.
today also i say i came before nineteen sixty six.
constitution article six (b)(two) does not permit that my lord. you have to make the
application before the twenty sixth of january. nineteen fifty and you have to make an
application.
that application.
so there's a fundamental distinction between clause two of section six a and article six
(b)(two) of the constitution, my lord. six (b)(two) came in because there was a permit
system.
as doctor ambedkar, said.
that's what i'm saying my lord. a permit system the nineteenth of july nineteen forty
eight.
i'm coming to that.
that's what i'm saying.
six a (three) says you have to apply.
but so far as two is concerned, my lord, you are shifting the date.
my first argument that you are shifting the date from the nineteenth of july '
forty eight to my lord the first of january nineteen sixty six by this legislation,
my lord. you can do a three hundred sixty eight route this argument will not
be available to my lord, but by parliamentary legislation.
you are shifting the date from the nineteenth of july ' forty eight to the
first of january nineteen sixty six and without those guideline riders which are there.
you are making it open ended even today.
wherever there is there was a time limit of the twenty sixth of january nineteen
fifty.
make an application so that people can authenticate on that day.
so that's a fundamental distinction which the chief justice, pointed out, and my submission is
that six a (two) and article six has a completely different scheme.
all right, then?
with this may i respectfully submit that draft constitution contained article five and six only
which translated into article five, nine and eleven.
it did not have article six, seven, eight and ten, which were introduced during the
debate by sri ambedkar, doctor ambedkar on the tenth of august nineteen forty nine, by
view of five (a), five (aa), five (b) and five (c).
and the debates which my learned solicitor read, in my respectful submission relate to the
draft articles five and six, there's a different debate and my lord expression of opinion
by all the three learned eminent members of the constituent assembly on five (a), five
(aa), five (b) and five (c), and our reason not regarding five (a) and five
(aa), which is article six and seven.
if your lordship kindly see that it contains a complete code.
i'll invite your lordship's attention.
mister hansaria what is your submission?
my submission is my lord that the submission of the central government, the learned solicitor
that the parliament was given due leverage to extend and amend under article eleven does
not apply to the persons who come under six and seven.
that is the migration from pakistan. and there is a clear distinction drawn by all
the three eminent members of the constituent assembly in the debate, and i'll show your
lordship is from the debate only.
what has been read to your lordship relate to general powers of the parliament, no
dispute, but not my lord those were covered by article six and seven, which is
article five (a) and five (b) (aa) draft constitution. would also see now kindly see
my lord, to this preface, volume four, the debates, my lord, page eight eighty seven.
you've made that point.
no my lord, please permit me to read that.
it goes.
we will not read that now.
we are at.
mister hansaria, you must understand you are in a rejoinder.
my lord, i'm in the rejoinder meeting the argument of the learned solicitor. you made
the point in your opening that look these people, you have taken the twenty fifth
of march nineteen seventy one.
on the twenty fifth of march nineteen seventy one, they were citizens of undivided pakistan.
liberation takes place much later.
therefore you can't confer on citizens of pakistan any provision which is beneficial by virtue
of the power and article eleven a, under article eleven, which is at variance with
the date of the nineteenth of july, nineteen forty eight.
what i'm saying is, i am meeting the argument.
the nineteenth of july according to article six is comprehensive in its coverage of those
who emanated from pakistan. i want to show that from the speeches made by the
learned three eminent authors, my lord. you put it in your written submission, we will
take as read.
we will read it later.
my lord, may i just say this?.
why don't you go to the next point?
i will.
not be doing justice to my brief and.
this is my main submission.
it will not.
would your lordships just permit me to show two or three things, because the submission
has been made by the learned solicitor that the due latitude was given by the
and from the speeches made by the doctor ambedkar, alladi swami and.
constituent assembly debate.
we can't control the language of the provision.
so, we got your point.
you made that point right in the opening.
that article eleven cannot give leverage to parliament to expand on the ambit of those
who are granted citizenship by article six and seven.
that is what founding father, said in the debate.
but we have to.
it's a point, worth considering.
we will consider it.
i've no doubt about that.
what i'm trying to say my lord, when extensively debates were read to your lordships,
my lord, it was said that parliament has been given complete leverage my lord, that
three eminent speakers, doctor ambedkar, alladi krishnaswamy iyer and kunzru's statements were read to your
lordships. i want to read they were in the context of article five, nine and
eleven, not in the context of my lord, six and seven which are draft article.
they specifically said, my lord. we've noted it now.
we've noted, we will read.
may i just give the page number then?
yeah. just give us the page number.
i will give the page numbers.
doctor ambedkar's speech starts from volume four, page eight hundred and eighty seven.
but the regarding this article five a and five (aa) is my lord, at page
eight hundred and ninety two and eight hundred and ninety three, in which my lord,
may i just only now.
gives us doctor ambedkar. sir alladi, sir alladi. on five a and five (aa) at
page eight hundred and ninety two and eight hundred and ninety three.
and just one sentence my lord. just give us alladi. sir alladi's reference.
alladi krishnaswamy iyer, my lord, relevant.
it starts at nine hundred and fifty three on the same volume.
which is on the twelfth of august. nine hundred and fifty three, starts.
the relevant is nine hundred and fifty five.
and pandit kunzru's speech starts from nine hundred and sixty one.
what is read to your lordships is nine hundred and sixty one.
and the relevant on this five a and five (aa) is nine hundred and sixty
two and nine hundred and sixty four.
and he clearly says this is extraordinary provision.
nowhere available in the world.
we are making it for an extraordinary situation like this has happened.
and up to nineteen forty eight only.
my lord, can the parliament extend the date from nineteen forty eight to ' sixty
six or to ' seventy one?
and all the three learned speakers who are founding fathers, and they are the heart
and soul of the entire constitution which they've made, my lord. made your point.
now, what is the next point?
i think.
my lord, i will cut short on other point, let me read one or two
paragraphs from this.
all right, read it.
you are twelve minutes short of rising time.
i will try to do.
i'll said, the handicap of the last batsman my lord. nine hundred and sixty two
to nine hundred and sixty four.
yes. may i just read nine hundred and fifty five for a minute?
nine hundred and fifty five, volume four, my lord. this is alladi krishna swamy iyer
explaining five a. five a is intended to provide for all cases of this mass
migration, if i may use this expression from pakistan into india and to provide for
that class of persons who have made present india as their home.
i will skip to that.
certain safeguards are provided for clause two, so as to make it quite clear that
the authorities cannot accept migrated people as bona fide citizens of this country.
that is the object of the clause.
this is the provision to the effect that no registration shall be made.
so my lord, it requires a registration as shown to your lordship, article six (b)(two).
unless the person making the application is residing in the territory for six months, so
there are two safeguards that will be registration there will be no registration unless the
applicant has resided in the territory for six months.
if five a stood by itself it would mean, that even if a person went
to pakistan with deliberate intention of making pakistan as a permanent home, and re-migrate to
india, they might be entitled to five a. in order to provide such a contention
that five a is provided, then quoted which is now six proviso.
there is no use of dealing with the subject if a person has deliberately and
intentionally chosen to be citizen of another country.
after question has arisen, after pakistan has declared territory independent from india, then there is
no point in conceding the citizenship to such a person but this proviso takes note
of this impertinent etcetera., etcetera.
so my lord clearly deals with, what is dot these are the extraordinary provisions which
have been set.
and at nine hundred and sixty two pandit kunzru says, last three lines of nine
hundred and sixty two and nine hundred and sixty three.
now nine hundred and sixty two if my lords can kindly go.
last paragraph.
now i shall come to article five a. in this article as it has been
criticised on the grounds of provisions undesirable open to the doors of citizens who have
no moral ground to be regarded.
i do not personally agree because let us consider calmly what five a, that is
article six lays down and the circumstance we require certain articles should form part of
our constitution. article five a and five aa. that is, article six and seven contain
extraordinary provisions arising out of the present extraordinary circumstances arising out of extraordinary situation created
by the partition of india. you will find no counterpart to them in the constitution
of any other country.
then they say that there are conditions which are prescribed.
now, my lord, section six a does away with all the conditions below with the
founding fathers try to justify for six and seven.
article six and seven.
so far as three hundred and sixty six is concerned.
no condition, no requirement which the founding fathers thought even forty eight requires my lord
and fifty requires.
so my lord, to say that, the founding father, thought gave untrammelled power to the
parliament to make law under eleven is not correct.
these observations does not apply or the statement does not apply to the extraordinary provision
made under six and seven.
that's my first submission.
second, my lord, your lordship would kindly see the constitution my lord, article seven starts
with a non-obstante clause against five and six.
article six, seven says notwithstanding five and six.
and six says, notwithstanding five.
so seven takes precedence.
and then six, then five.
kindly see that my lord. yes. so, my lord, if seven is to be given
precedence, that fixes the cutoff date as the first of march, nineteen forty seven.
so, anybody who has come to india after going to pakistan after the first of
march nineteen forty seven, he does not get citizenship.
under six, he gets a citizenship up to ' forty eight and thereafter, my lord,
he has to go by the registration and application, etc,.
etcetera.
now the section six a (two) and (three) mister divan has said, so far as
two is concerned, there are four requirements and unending requirements.
even today, there's no cut off required date my lord for that.
six a (three) requires two more conditions for my lord.
that is, he must be detected to be foreigner by the foreigners' tribunal and he
must apply for registration.
now, would your lordship kindly consider it my lord saying that as per the affidavit
of the government of india, thirty thousand and odd has been detected to be foreigner
till date.
so it must never, it cannot be open ended.
it must confine to those thirty thousand alone.
it cannot be my lord millions till after.
in case my lord wish to held my lord six a to be valid.
my submission is not the four conditions which mister divan has said, and that is
what i have said in my rejoined submissions, which is circulated to your lordship, those
four conditions.
plus, he must be declared as a foreigner, my lord by the foreigner's tribunal. plus
he must make an application.
and this must be confined to the thirty thousand people.
because till today, my lord thirty thousand people has only been detected to be foreigner.
can it be said after one hundred years it becomes three million?
would your lordship kindly see the written submission of my lord which you have circulated
today.
and in paragraph nine, my lord, paragraph three if they have not been detected till
date.
my lord, where is the question of granting them citizenship a lot up to the
millions of people, as mister choudhury has said, no it may be it is an
apprehension.
it has happened.
so lordship would confine in your judgment, my lord. that's what.
you can kindly see my lord para three of my rejoinder submission circulated today which
is there before your lordship's screen.
para three and para nine which says not the six conditions are mentioned in para
nine, and my lord i have submitted that.
thus the grant of citizens of the person entering india after the nineteenth of july
forty eight must comply with the mandatory condition.
it is submitted that the section six a (two) required expressive.
and the government of india says thirty thousand.
so it must be confined to those thirty thousand people and not beyond that my
lord. that's our submission before your lordship. next submission before my lord they have the
plenary power.
no doubt they have the plenary power but it is not my lord if your
lordship contradict, see this article four (two) for a minute and contrast it with article
eleven.
four (two) says my lord, no law made under four (one) shall be deemed to
be amendment to the constitution. but article eleven does not say.
so whatever law you made under article eleven or two hundred and forty six entry
eleven must be consistent with other provisions of the constitution, which would include six, seven,
article fourteen, etcetera., and there are ten provisions of the nature of article four (two)
shall also see article four (two) for a minute, it says, may not.
no such law as a aforesaid shall be deemed to be an amendment to this
constitution for the purpose of article three hundred sixty eight for a minute my lord
kindly see.
and my lord there are such ten provisions, which is in my written submission.
paragraph. main written submissions, volume one, page one hundred and forty six your lordship would
find.
there are ten provisions in the constitution which says law made under this foregoing provision
shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the constitution, and that's not, my
lord. so if you cannot amend, the constitution by the circuitous method.
in your lordship yesterday judgment, rule three hundred and seventy, paragraph three hundred and ninety,
my lord, achieved the you cannot use three hundred and sixty seven method to change
three hundred and seventy.
this is the same thing.
you cannot use the circuitous method of a parliamentary legislation to amend the constitution, which
you can do only under three hundred and sixty eight route, not the three hundred
forty six route my lord.
so that's my next submission before your lordships kind consideration.
and i initially submitted, my lord, that the persons who get citizenship under section six
and seven, five, six my lord, they must admit they must take an oath of
allegiance to the constitution of india. so far as six a is concerned, my lord,
there is no such requirement of oath of allegiance and.
they come from a country in which it is recognized islam is the.
islamic country of pakistan. in my recent submissions, i have said, my lord in case
your lordship wants to held that.
six a is valid.
any person who are given those thirty thousand person or seventy thousand person, they must
subscribe an oath in the form of schedule two.
and also, my lord, they must say, if your lordship kindly see my written submissions,
in rejoinder written submissions para eight my lord. lordship kindly make a note.
in para eight i say that there is no answer to the oath of allegiance.
and will not rule nineteen (two) and form eighteen under which they make an application.
if your lordship sees that my lord. yes. i have another two minutes.
i have another three balls to play.
para eight of my rejoinder submissions.
yes. i have noted, my lord, under rule nineteen (two) of the citizenship rule and
form eighteen of the citizenship rule. they are required to make an application.
in that application your lordship would read it my lord they must subscribe in oath
in some second schedule to the citizenship act. they must additionally say i believe in
the secularism and i will uphold the unity and integrity of india. that's a very
serious concern of ours my lord. so those conditions my lord would incorporate that in
case your lordships were to held it is constitutionally valid.
and finally my lord the note by the government of india says there are one
hundred tribunals and there are ninety six thousand cases.
that means that one thousand cases per tribunal. we do not know how many years
it will take.
not to decide those cases.
just your lordships note factually, two hundred tribunals were constituted on june second twenty twenty.
sorry?
twenty six?
sixth of february twenty twenty, two hundred additional tribunals were constituted my lord by the
government of india to decide these cases.
but they were discontinued on, the fourteenth of october, twenty twenty two.
i have that order of the government of india, my lord. the fourteenth of october,
twenty twenty two, all these two hundred tribunals were discontinued, saying that there is no
sufficient work.
and in fact, i must point it out, some of the members of the tribunal
filed a writ petition, before lordships and my lord, the chief justice said, my lord,
this is not a public interest litigation.
your term was under a contract.
so, you cannot go beyond that.
and lordships say that in case it is there, then it will be considered in
accordance with law.
so, what i'm saying your lordship, in case your lordship was to held against me,
there are only one hundred tribunals. two hundred tribunals were constituted.
they were discontinued on the fourteenth of october, twenty twenty two, they have to.
my lord, all these cases have to be decided fast, my lord. it cannot be
remained for, another five years, ten years these cases will pending.
so, those tribunals. one minute, my lord, one important judgment is missed.
yes. it's under six a, therefore, my lord, it's necessary for me to cite.
volume five, page five thousand two hundred and thirty eight, the relevant part.
my lord, six.
it starts at five thousand two hundred and twenty six it was concerned with.
i would be missing if i don't cite this.
since mister divan cited my lord, this ordinary resident is not defined.
in rejoinder, i did not cite it.
it's on record six a (two).
my lord, your lordships have my lord, page five thousand two hundred and thirty eight.
otherwise i may read.
five thousand two hundred and thirty eight? five thousand two hundred and thirty eight.
just give us the citation.
yes. nineteen ninety four, supplementary one scc, page six hundred and fifteen, paragraph is sixty
two.
please read, my lord, it's a short, five-line paragraph.
under six a, sub-section two.
i'm sorry.
the condition number two of six a. my lords, five thousand two hundred and thirty
eight.
my lords. may i read para sixty two?
turning to condition number two, the requirement is ordinarily resident in assam, from the date
of entry, till the incorporation of section six a, namely, december seventh, nineteen eighty five.
as to the meaning of ordinary resident, we may refer to shanno devi versus so
and so.
this is a constitution bench. we find the following observations at page five hundred and
ninety opposing.
it is not necessary that for every day of this period, he should have resided
in india. in absence of the definition of the words ordinarily resident in the constitution,
it is reasonable to take the words to mean, residents during this period, without any
serious.
that's it.
anything else?
i'm extremely grateful, my lord. in the rejoinder submissions, my lord, because i had very
limited time, in the rejoinder submissions whatever i have said, i filed today are before
your lordships. certainly. thank you, everyone.
grateful to your lordships.
