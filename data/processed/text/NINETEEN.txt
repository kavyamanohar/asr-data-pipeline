my lord, so far as the constitutional scheme emerging from the conjoint
reading of entry 54 list i and entry 23 and 50 of
list ii is concerned, mr. salve has already taken your lordships from
hingir-rampur till kesoram judgment, which i'll not dwell much upon except for 10 minutes.
just a brief overview, but my lord, i would.
yes. i'm sorry, my lord.
i would like to place before your lordships the government's perspective why
the architecture of the mmdr act is the way it is and
how it impacts the power of the state versus power of the centre.
but before i do that, i want to make one thing very, very clear
because the impression which is unintentionally gathered is this that this is kind of
a federal issue between centre and the state
and who has the legislative competence to levy.
at the outset i say that is not the question here.
my lord, here and as i will explain in
a little more detail with some facts, figures and statistics.
yes.
the way mmdra works, and it is intended
to work as a limitation, is this my lord.
it is not a fact in dispute that the mineral
rights and the ownership of mineral vests with the states,
and therefore, every penny of royalty goes to the state government.
if your lordship would not like to write
down, i have the propositions also, my lord.
in the end, my lord, i can give the propositions.
yes. just to make it more convenient for your lordship.
yes. now every penny goes, the state government grants the lease.
the lease deed format is provided in the central statute.
the state government collects the royalty. the royalty figure is fixed by the central government.
the state government appropriates that royalty amount with other amounts
which i will show as a part of its consolidated fund.
yes.
these are not the facts which are in dispute or which can be in dispute.
yes.
now my lord, why the centre discharges the function
of only fixing the rate of royalty qua each mineral?
there are several factors my lord, which i will show.
but broadly, to ensure uniformity in the price structure throughout the country.
yes.
and my lord, our domestic price structure, we'll have to take into consideration, two factors.
i'm just giving a broad overview.
one, the domestic requirement, which can only be decided at the central level.
and second, since the royalty has a direct nexus with
the price of each mineral, we will have to be
very, very careful and conscious about the global market qua that mineral.
if that mineral is cheaper somewhere else, people
would start importing, indian domestic users and vice versa.
so, it directly impacts the import-export. i’ll, my lord, go that.
go into the details. next, and the most important thing.
my lord, as i would show from one
report, which is report a prepared every 3 years.
your lordships are aware section 9 provides that the royalty will.
the rates of royalty would be changed every 3 years.
there is a report prepared. it was really heartening to know.
yes. a classic example of cooperative and collaborative federalism.
what the central government does? your lordship need not write.
my lord, in my note, your lordship would find everything.
we call for the views from all stakeholders.
stakeholders would mean industries; stakeholder would mean people
who are going to be affected by the industries.
because ultimately, we have to protect the environment as well.
and essentially, and more importantly the state governments.
i'll show my lord, from the last report of
2019 that the state very effectively involved in the process.
they say that - 'this particular mineral, bauxite, please increase it
by 2%. because this is our revenue generation. these are the
reasons why it should be something more.' then, i'm sorry my lord.
then the subgroup after receiving all these detailed inputs examines 'what are
the global scenario?', 'what will be the impact on the export-import?' all
these minerals are required for the core industrial sector of the domestic market.
that is taken into consideration. the core industrial sector is the heartbeat of any economy.
my lord, that is considered, and i will show that to your lordship.
and thereafter, with reasons why the state's request is either
accepted or not accepted, a price is fixed qua each mineral.
and thereafter, the central government is out of it.
now you collect, you appropriate, you do whatever
welfare activities you want to do in your state.
the only dispute between the parties, my lord, in these proceedings is, after having.
it is our case, that when we decide the amount of royalty, the
figure of royalty, that is all inclusive, taking into consideration all your requirements.
what the states say that over and above the
royalty, we can independently levy certain amount under various names.
what we believe and what my lord the act perceives,
the objective of the act is that whatever i am
saying my lord, i'll be able to make good from the record.
suppose iron ore or bauxite.
some amount is fixed, say 100 rupee per
ton or per whatever pits mouth value, et cetera.
that also was argued, but i'll show that's not relevant for this purpose.
so, the amount comes to, say, 1000 per ton giving an absolutely hypothetical example.
they say that every state will have a power to levy more than 1000.
we say no, it is all inclusive.
and the reason is this.
if every state starts imposing further levy, in some case it would be
1500 per ton, in some state it would be only 1000 per ton.
in some state it could be 1100 per ton.
the uniformity of the prices will not be maintained.
and i want to flag below that issue
before i take your lordship through this my lord.
mr. solicitor, as you are formulating your thoughts and you have given the
example of bauxite and you say that this rate that is determined and
you said that this is done after elaborate consultation with the stakeholders, including state.
and then you say the state is trying to extract over
and above the all-inclusive price that you are suggesting to us.
that's correct.
now, taking a cue from the example of bauxite have you not boxed in
this tape so far as exercise of their power under 50, entry 50 list (ii).
i could not understand the last.
you see, i have said that you have boxed in everything.
so where does the state have the power to exercise under entry 50 their power?
that's my lord.
respectful submission let the entire architecture of mmrda, under which this box price, inclusive
of everything, is fixed, is a limitation on the state's legislative power under 50.
it's totally denuded you see, the state's power.
that's my respectful submission. correct. but otherwise.
i'll just give an example, my lord, why this creates a problem.
why should the. of course just asking.
you are just at the starting point.
why should the act, the statute, not say that this
is what the tax that the union is charging and
to that extent the power this denuded or something to that effect?
why are we asked to read this by inference?
my lord, my legal submission would be different.
we also have the situation of -- i mean
i was just discussing article 265 which will be forthcoming.
it is there. it's there. invalid tax.
it will be unconstitutional.
but i'll be able to show that there is an
inbuilt statutory mechanism which says that this amount and nothing more.
otherwise, my lord what happens. just giving.
of course, example would not be the basis for your lordships to decide.
but i'm just giving an example, the rationale
why my lord this is under the central control.
the fixation.
suppose there are two states a and b.
a has electricity generation station of a huge capacity.
they are using coal as a raw material.
b has raw material mines, my lord.
they are namely the coal mines.
they say that over and above rs. 1000,
which is the royalty fixed by the central government.
i'll give examples.
in many states, pre–india cements, other cess- education cess, different
nomenclatures - was 300% royalty, 500% royalty, et cetera, et cetera.
so that state a having the electricity generation plant will have to either
pay more from state b because every state has a different price structures.
mr. solicitor, that is implicit in a federal scheme, you, see?
therefore, unless you say that, look when you fix, as you call it, an
all inclusive royalty that royalty includes all taxes also that can be levied by state.
you have to go as far as to establish that .
correct. that the fixation of royalty is itself inclusive of all taxes states nothing more.
that's one.
second your argument that, well, it's desirable that
there should be uniformity of the price of minerals.
it may be a desirable.
it may be a desirable matter as a matter of policy.
the question is whether this will impinge upon
the federal distribution of power into the constitution.
now take another case, there are several taxes
the states can levy under the state list.
i'll just give you two examples.
entry 53 of list ii - taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity, right?
now in various industries, electricity is not just a medium, but it's a raw material.
for instance, in the production of steel, iron-steel industry.
electricity itself is a raw material. it's on the price structure also.
right?
and now the constitution contemplates that each individual state can
levy a tax on the consumption and sale of electricity.
now different states levying taxes at a different rate on the consumption and
sale of electricity will meet with the same argument that you are urging
that in maharashtra may impose it at a different rate, karnataka may do
it as a , solar plant in rajasthan may do it at a different rate.
but that's part of the federal scheme or take entry 54 -
taxes on sale and sale of petroleum crude, high speed diesel -
high speed diesel is crucial for industry - motor spirit, natural gas.
so, if you are consuming natural gas from,
say, which comes in from jamnagar, different rate altogether.
if you are importing natural gas, which has come in through, say,
a crude pipeline, a gas pipeline say in chennai, completely different rate.
that's exactly the scheme of the constitution and there is
nothing sui generis about minerals that there should be a uniformity.
now the same logic will apply to electricity, have
the same rate of electricity, same taxes for electricity .
that example and i'll give the answer.
i'll give the answer. in other entries like electricity or entry 54 list ii.
there is no provision like entry 50 that's
subject to limitations placed by the parliament under 54.
therefore, there is a safeguard. suppose, say jharkhand places taxes at the rate of 500%.
ignore that example. i'll make it good on other.
suppose some state levies taxes at the rate of, say,
300%, something disproportionate, which will really affect the industry, and
that state is a primary source of that mineral in india.
parliament can certainly regulate the rates.
when you are prescribing limitations, you can say that - 'look rates
will not exceed so and so. rates on this mineral will not
exceed so and so.' you can have differing limitations for differing minerals.
my lords, please ignore that example for the time being.
union has not thought through.
how they can use the limitation power, imposing power to
ensure that whether states are not restricted in imposing taxes.
the taxation structure in a state does not affect overall
the development of the mineral or the development of the industry.
parliament can still do it, but they have to do
it in a nuanced case by case, mineral by mineral basis.
that is where my lord, we would respectfully argue that
mmrda is that restriction what is the constitution says limitation on.
this is sui generis for the simple reason.
this is the only entry, taxing entry which is made subject to some other entry.
there is no other taxing entry. number one.
number two, in case of.
it is not made subject to the other entries; it is made
subject to limitation in the interest of regulation and development of minerals.
so, it's emphasised very carefully. mr. solicitor, if you want to sit for a minute?
no. i am okay. the limitation is a constitutional limitation.
it is not any kind of limitation.
so, a constitutional limitation has to be read
in the context of article 265 of the constitution.
and that too in public interest.
because there can be no taxation except with authority of law.
so, a constitutional limitation to tax juxtapose with article 265 must be the.
correct, my lord. i bow down. interpretation.
i bow down. my lord, second, as my lord, i am putting.
mr. solicitor, you have to answer.
you're banking upon the fact that states have say in determining royalty.
there, you may not be right.
under section 9(3), it is the exclusive power of
the central government to decide what is the royalty.
states have no power. see section 9, sub-section.
it is exclusive domain of the central government.
states do not have any say in fixing royalty.
if your lordships can, my lord, consider allowing me to develop further.
we are just pointing out so that you can answer it.
certainly, my lord. i'm conscious of the fact that the consultation is not statutorily contemplated.
that's what my lords are very rightly putting it to me, but
the consultation is read in every provision, that's what i'm going to show.
please take my written submissions, my lord.
where do we get them? volume ii(f).
and my lord, i will ignore whatever is
argued or whatever may perhaps not be relevant immediately.
volume? ii(f). it should be ii(e). it was thereafter changed.
there was some mistake. at night, my lord.
we should ignore (e)? yes. please ignore.
and possible delete it. if it is possible to delete.
annexure was wrong. instead of 'the report of 2019', 'report of '90' was annexed.
there was nothing to hide in there, but that was no relevance of that.
got it, page? page 5. page 4, pdf 5.
i'm sorry. pdf 4. i'll skip what is not relevant.
but what is relevant, please allow me to read.
this history relates back to the industrial policy.
i'm not reading it, but i'll just.
i have annexed.
my lords, historically, not immediately, but at some
time after independence, we declared our industrial policy.
first was '48 and thereafter '56.
i have annexed it for your lordship's reference and record.
but i'm not going to read it.
but, the intention to place this is this, my lord, that the nation for the
first time decided how our industrial growth will take place, what would be the roadmap.
and there, they divided certain sectors in schedule a, schedule b, schedule
c, and schedule d, where core minerals were placed in schedule a.
because they are directly or indirectly responsible for industrial growth of other industries.
that's the purpose. now please come to pdf 6, my lord, para 4.
pdf 5, my lord. i'm sorry. pdf 5, para 4.
i'm sorry. this is wrong. i'm sorry.
pdf 6. i am as usual behind the rest.
para 4, my lord.
'the industrial policy resolution 1956 put major minerals such as coal, lignite,
mineral oil, iron ore, copper, zinc, atomic minerals, et cetera, in schedule
a, which was reserved exclusively for public sector. and minor minerals in
schedule b, which the private sector, was allowed to participate in mining
activities.' your lordships can, my lord, thereafter, come to page 5, para 5.
'the minerals available in the nation, are naturally finite and are perhaps
the most valuable resource for the development of the country. minerals are
the vital raw material for the core sectors of the economy. the
exploration, extraction and management of minerals have to be guided by national
goals and perspectives to be integrated into an overall strategy of country's economic development.
the endeavour shall be to promote domestic industry and
reduce import dependency which make domestic industry resilient and self-sustainable.
' my lord, this is the difference in other cases, like
electricity, et cetera, we don't have to see the global market.
that can be, my lord.
and please, my lord, for the time being, allow me to say please.
don't treat this as a federal issue.
there is no state vs centre it is the state
government which collects everything only for the reasons which will follow.
the price figure, royalty fixation, the quantification is done by the
centre, keeping the global phenomena and the domestic scenario in mind.
then your lordships may come to 7, para 8.
this is my lord, more relevant why.
to answer the chief justice of india's query, why
minerals stand on a different footing and why it's fixation.
fixation of everything which is to be extracted from
whoever is liable to pay is to be federally governed.
if i may use that expression.
'(a) the mining sector and extraction of mineral, by the very
nature of the subject, requires to be taken up holistically at
a national level as its regulation and development shall have to
be based upon the following.' my lord, please see each one of them carefully.
'national landscape for protection, exploration and extraction of mining. mineral being a national
wealth, its distribution for the benefit of every citizen of each state, as
per principles of socialism enshrined in the preamble.' then, 3) 'impact of high
burden of levy on indian minerals in comparison to international mining jurisdiction.' this is crucial.
my lord, if high burden is put on each mineral by different states
differently, we may not be able to my lord deal with the global situation.
4) is really crucial my lord, according to me. i'm sorry.
your lordships when examines or the interpret the entries or any constitutional principle.
your lordship would examine, would keep in mind these factors
because these are in public interest as administered under 54.
but let me proceed rather than. para 4.
parliament can always say that while prescribing limitations, apropos to your submission.
we understand the policy issue in the submission.
but parliament can always say that -'look, the carrying cost
of this particular mineral should not exceed a certain amount.
' so, then you can indirectly ensure that the tax structure out of hand.
that is said. that is said.
i want to show that if your lordship
can, just bear with me for some time.
i'm just giving the justification for it.
and this is my answer, that architecture itself is a limitation.
please see my lord 4. depends this one is really crucial for the nation.
'dependence of.' and for the time being, your lordships
may consider, put below these two entries on the side.
just examine bear a situation, my lord, which the country is dealing with.
and thereafter, i'll come to two entries and how the law has taken care of.
'dependence of imports for certain minerals and regulation of exports of domestic minerals, use
of which is needed for the core domestic industries.' now, please note this my lord.
'the import and export is mostly based upon the comparative price fixation in domestic
as well as global market and such price fixation shall depend upon the levy
of royalty and other others imposed on each mineral in india.' meaning thereby, if
we overtax a particular mineral or suppose some mineral is available only in two states.
it is over taxed, then the domestic industry in rest of the
india would go for importing the cheaper mineral from the other countries.
this has a direct national impact. then 5.
'the national concern about growth of mineral sector at a national level so
as to ensure that share of mineral industry contributes in the country's gdp.
' when we say that we have a law for regulation and development of
mines and minerals, we also mean, that we wanted to regulate and developed in
such a fashion that it contributes to the gdp as a sector, not state wise.
then 6.
'the fixation of consolidated amount like royalty, et cetera, at a national level
for each mineral will ensure availability of domestic mineral at a reasonable price
as compared to international prices. separate levy regime by mineral restates results into
disparity and high cost of domestic production, leading to closure of mines, necessitating
import of cheaper mineral from global market. fixation of the total levy on
minerals in such a manner that not only the concern of all mineral
rich but the concerns of mineral deficient states are also taken care of.'
because the industries would be situated, core industries which
are using these minerals, my lord in other non-mineral states.
so, they get one particular mineral at one particular price, and they don't start
importing or if some state decreases the royalty, they can even start exporting .
my lord, i can face the contention that you remove the.
you stop the export. but mmrda is a one-time solution.
one solution that - 'no, we will fix everything.' so, there
is no difficulty in domestic production, domestic pricing vis-a-vis global price.
then my lord, 9.
just as you are fixing the rate of royalty, is it not possible, as
the learned chief justice said, to have a ceiling or fix a rate of tax?
the power to tax is with the state.
that is there.
but you can have a rate of tax or a ceiling
on the tax to have uniformity with regard to taxes also.
my lord, constitutionally, it's going to be my submission that under entry
50 it says - 'tax on mines and minerals subject to limitations
imposed.' this is the only entry where taxing power is denuded by
the central law for mines and minerals if it is in public interest.
the judicial inquiry would be while examining entry 50,
whether this is a tax by the state -yes.
whether there is a law made by parliament under entry
54 list i for regulation and development of minerals and
i'll show all this comes within development and regulation of minerals.
and third, whether that law of parliament is
contrary to federal structure or is in public interest.
i am showing my lord public interest, right now.
now 8, my lord - 'to bring in uniformity in the structure of
regulation and development of minerals in other aspects so as to make it
an investor friendly regime, incentivizing more investment in that mineral sector while balancing
environmental concern as a holistic national level. the development of mineral industry needs
uniformity at a national level, failing which, fragmented state wise levy will adversely
impact the development of minerals and systemic utilization of minerals in larger public
interest.' the moment there is an act under entry 54, regulating and providing
for development of minerals, that puts a limitation on the
taxing power, apart from the specific limitation, which i'll show.
but my lord, my first respectful submission is that the architecture of
the mmdra, the rules framed there under and the formats, statutory formats.
statutory formats in k. specimen k. not specimen.
form k. mr. salve read one part of it.
but i will read the other part of it, which
specifically says, that 'you are being given lease.' what is lease?
mineral is a national resource. it's owned by the people.
government is only a custodian, a trustee.
in 5 judge bench, your lordships have accepted this principle regarding natural resources, et cetera.
what we are giving my lord, by way of a lease.
we mean the 'state'.
right to extract, sell and appropriate the sale
proceeds of something which is a national resource.
in consideration of that, what is paid, is 'royalty'.
and my lord, the way, form k is couched, says that - 'this,
this, this and nothing else.' royalty, rent, dead rent and rent, nothing else.
that's my lord, the statutory contract one enters into when one takes the privilege
of sharing the national wealth and appropriating it for commercial use, which is also necessary.
i'm not opposing that concept. now, your lordships kindly come to, para 12.
it means 9. pdf 9, my lord.
i'm skipping what is not necessary, my lord.
there is one thing, you may not skip, mr. solicitor general.
come to para 9. my lord. iv.
this seems to be the sub-stratum, the heart and soul of your.
what your lordship means 'answer'. right? correct.
the only contention is, the state's assertion that over and above the amount of
royalty fixed by the central government with their active consultation, they can still independently
impose levies, exercising its legislative competence under entry 50 list ii of the seventh schedule.
your principal argument is that every penny of royalty goes to the state.
no problem.
my lord, justice oka pointed out sub-clause 3 of section 9 of the act.
just give us some illustration. one or two.
what are.
what is the nature of other levies which
you are talking about over and above royalty?
it comes subsequently. my lord, in pre–india cement era.
so, one clarification. yes, my lord.
is it your complaint that they are not adhering
to schedule ii, which fixes the rate of royalties?
they may be strictly adhering to the price fixed in schedule ii.
but over and above those, royalty, they are levying some other taxes.
yes. and what they do is.
your argument is that that is not permissible by virtue of article 54.
read with 50. right? that's your argument.
so, what are these other levies, which is impermissible for the state to impose?
yes, my lord. please come to.
i'll answer that first and then come back to my lord, my.
correct. page of 55, my lord, if your lordships can come.
55, my lords. please see, my lord, para 93.
just to immediately answer my lord's question.
my lord justice pardiwala's. then you may proceed in your own way.
i'll come back to. this will give insight.
this is very pertinent question. and i also want to highlight this.
this is all which is. it's a bone of contention.
it's not an adversarial. para 55? para 93, my lord.
page 55. yes. page 55, yes. para 93, my lord.
your ladyships get? your ladyship gets? got it.
yes. i'll read.
'it is submitted that a decision permitting state to impose taxes on minerals,
mineral rights, would inevitably lead to a return to the scenario prevalent prior
to india cement judgment. this would be contrary to public interest, et cetera.'
now 94 -'to get a sense of the scenario prior to india cement
one may refer to the rates of cess, or tax imposed by states
at that time, as derived from the report
of the study group on revision of rates of.
' - this is the source -'published in march '90. the rates
imposed were these.' for example, the first state, cess at 25% of royalty.
then cess at 37% of royalty.
so, it's a royalty plus the cess at 25%,
which, according to you, is objectionable and not permissible.
yes, and please see further - 'mineral rights tax on coal at 300% of
royalty.' my lord, today i can show after kesoram, it is 500% in one state.
i don't want to go into state versus centre.
then mineral rights tax on other minerals, 100% of royalty.
then please see the next state.
cess on iron ore at 300% of royalty, then cess
on limestone and pyrite at 200% of royalty, cess on
bauxite, china clay, dolomite and fire clay at 133.33% of royalty.
therefore mr. solicitor, now, you have given us the building
blocks of your argument by suggesting that -'look, if the
states are left untrammelled to impose taxes, what would be the impact?
states will start imposing radically disproportionate taxes, variant taxes, so on.
' we've got that point.
i think the heart of your matter really
is, how do you read the mmdr act?
and you may be right.
you can demonstrate that to us, because that's really the crux
of the matter, how do you read the mmdr act as
imposing a limitation on the state power to tax under entry 54.
i get that my lord. that is the heart of the matter.
so, you just spell out now those provisions of the mmdr act,
which can be construed as limitations on the state power to tax,
because that they also concede that the entry of the states, entry
providing for taxes and mineral rights is subject to the union power to impose limitations.
now, the question is whether you have, in fact, as parliament imposed a limitation.
and which are those limitations? so, you can spell out to us.
that really is the core of the matter.
may i come to that answer, my lord, a little later.
10 minutes later.
before that, i want your lordship to see, how section
9 is understood and how that consultative process has taken place.
it would be necessary, my lord, before you.
which page of your submissions?
how section 9 has worked so far and i would also.
why i'm not immediately answering this question.
when mmrda was enacted, there are parliamentary debates that -'we want
to denuded the states from putting any other thing, any other levy.
' therefore, there is some chronology which i have conceived.
your lordships can take it from me. there are two types.
as i have earlier also said that person who has
something to say and person who has to say something.
my lord, i would fall in first category.
your lordships can rest assured.
there is something new which, from the state's perspective,
your lordships, sitting in this combination must know, that's all.
yes.
is it your argument that section 9 is exhaustive
of all the levies which a state can impose?
yes. on the right to mine. yes.
section 9 read with section 13, the rulemaking power,
read with rule 31, read with annexure f, the format.
and that i will now connect, but before that some
history may be necessary, for some facts may be necessary.
please come to see.
i earnestly request your lordships to see the scheme of the act
and the rules in the context of what i am going to show.
please come to page 112. i have produced report.
my lord, for only this kindly allow me to use the physical copy.
there was some confusion at night when i read some other
report was annexed therefore my underlining is in the physical copy.
i'll revert back to the digital copy, my lord.
it's 113, my lord.
and in this context, after this, showing this, i'll immediately come to the scheme.
proof for revision of rates. immediately i'll come to the scheme.
this is a report of the study group for revision of rates.
please mark this my lord. this exercise happens every three years as per section 93.
the solicitor general got away by saying, please permit me to use the hard copy.
i do not know whether the bench members have that privilege or not.
my lord, i admit, i am technologically challenged.
no, i put myself in the same footage.
and not only you and i, but i'm sure there are others also.
but substantially we have shifted.
but what happened was at midnight not midnight, 01:00 when i
was, my lord, marking my notes so that i can give
exact paginations, i found that the annexure, this annexure was wrongly put.
it was another report which was put so i could not my lord.
we have the one by dr. k. rajeshwara?
yes. i had the hard copy so i marked hard copy.
rest my lord i am on the digital.
please come to page 118.
how this is holistically and at a federal level considered and your lordship may
note, this exercise has taken place every three years after the act was passed.
section 9, apropos justice oka's query. my lords are right.
textually, it does not provide for consultation.
but i must point out, when this act was enacted, some states in
the parliament said they provide for a consultation, which was opposed by the
government of the day, and consultation was not placed as a statutory provision.
but it has always been read.
and look at the level of consultation which will give.
my lord, i'm not showing it for nothing.
which will give the honourable bench, my lord,
the idea, why national level fixation of one price?
and what are the considerations which are going into it?
which can never be done if it is fragmented, state wise imposition.
that's the purpose of showing this. please see, my lord, 118.
the first para -'the principles of.
'and my lord, kindly bear with me. i'll go a little slowly.
so far as this report is concerned.
'the principles of royalty rest on an accepted legal and customary base. minerals are non-renewable
assets which once removed, cannot be replenished. as owner of minerals, the state needs to
be adequately compensated for the permanent loss of an asset, thus depleted. royalty, therefore, whether
fixed as a share of profit from the mining industry or as a compensation for
a depleting asset is a consequence of ownership of an asset, to which, the title
is transferred.' my lord, this is to answer, whether it is a tax or not.
please come to page 119.
'royalty regime in british india.' it has always been federal dominated.
for this reason, my lord.
'in the british regime, grant of mineral concessions were regulated by government of
india act 1913. subsequently, as per the government of india act '35, many
constitutional changes were brought about under this act and minerals became provincial subject.
as a consequence, then provincial government of assam, bihar, bombay
and united provinces framed their own rules for granting mining concessions.
in 1939, the government of india framed, 'mining concession rules 39' for
regulating the grant of prospecting licenses and mining leases in centrally administered area.
the mining concession rules, specified royalties on mica, petroleum and natural
gas, oil, shell, gold and silver, iron ore and precious stones.
and the rest of the mineral were not specified.
the royalty was based on a specific percentage of the sale value in respect
of specified minerals, except oil, shell, iron ore, gold, silver, and so and so.
' now 'present legislative provisions', your lordships can, consider
skipping and come to chapter 2, page 121, para 2.4.
i have marked it.
so that i may not have to read what is not directly
relevant' but your lordships can go through it at leisure, if required.
2.4, your lordships have, my lord? 121.
or may i read?
'with a view to have comprehensive review of the royalty rates on all
minerals, in terms of its impact on production, mineral based industries, export and
the state revenues for the first time in the year 1966 union government
set up a study group. this study group submitted its report in 1968
and recommended delinking of royalty rates from the pit's mouth value for most
of the minerals and suggested unit of production that is tonnage, as the basis.
because of the difficulties experienced by the states, in administration of charging royalty as
per value of minerals at the pit's mouth, which led to litigations and disputes.
subsequent study groups constituted in the year '73,
'78, '84, and '89, retained the tonnage system.
' please see 2.6, my lord.
'as a result of the adoption of the policy of economic liberalization and
also as a sequel to international roundtable conference held in new delhi in
april '94 under the aegis of the undp the ministry of mines constituted
a study group in january '95 with a view to rationalize the rates
of royalty to make them comparable with the international rates.' please mark this.
i am on entire act being read as
a limitation and the act is in public interest.
please my lord allow me to proceed further.
'international rates and at the same time ensure rapid development of
mining industry and augmentation of revenue earnings of the state governments.'
this is treated as a part of development of mining industry.
this national level price fixation is treated as a
part of development of mining industry, which is the act.
therefore, my lord, i said - 'the act itself
is a limitation.' i'll point out the specific provisions also.
and it also says that we want to augment the revenue of the states.
so therefore, at the cost of repetition, i'm saying -'this is not a federal issue.
state versus centre.
' yes, legislative competence of parliament versus legislative competence of
state assembly is an issue, but not a confrontational federal issue.
then 2.9.
ultimately, i'll show that entire act occupies the
field as a limitation to entry 50 list ii.
that's one of my attempts. that's why i'm going in a particular chronology.
2.9, my lord.
'consequent to the notification of royalty rates in 2004, a high-level committee was set
up under the chairmanship of sri. so and so, member, planning commission to review
the national mineral policy and recommend possible amendments in the mmdra. the recommendations of
the hlc in respect of royalty were as
under.' please see only (d) and (e) my lord.
'a lowering of rates to be considered only for such mineral, for
which there is evidence to show that the royalty rates are inhibiting.
mining operations and mineral production is registering a downward trend.' they have
studied and recommended this, and these recommendations are the foundation for subsequent fixation of royalties.
'the royalty rates of base metals, noble metals, and precious stones in which the
country is grossly deficient needs to be low to encourage exploration for these minerals.'
this also cannot be done fragmented way by the respective state governments and the
act, as i will show the architecture, acts
as a limitation on any other taxing power.
then your lordship, kindly turn the page and
just three lines above para 2.11 at pdf 124.
4 line, my lord.
'this schedule to the mines and mineral development act on escalating scale, taking
into consideration measures for effective deterrence against the mines. both the recommendations of
this study group the revised rates of the royalty, et cetera.' then 2.11
'the period between 2007-2011 witnessed significant development in the indian mining sector, mineral
sector. based on the recommendations of hooda committee, government of india in consultation
with state governments, replace the national mineral policy with new national mineral policy
on 13th march 2008. the national mineral policy provides for a change in
the role of the central government and the state governments, particularly in relation
to incentivizing the private sector investment in exploration and mining and ensuring level
playing field and transparency in the grand of concession,
et cetera.' now, please my lord turn the page over.
chapter 3, pdf 126. my lord. i'm sorry.
there is a global view is examined by the committee, and this is
examined every time when there is a revision of royalty rates takes place.
now come to 129, last 3 lines.
these are all factors which would lead credence to my argument subject to my
lord's approval that the act, architecture of the act and reading section 9, the
way my lord central government has read, operates as a limitation contemplated under entry 50.
last 4 lines. 'it is evident.' the lordship gets 129?
'it is evident that prevailing royalty rates in other countries are much lower
than india and mainly in the range of 2.5% to 7.5% on ad
valorem basis. for ease of comparison, 15 mineral rich countries have been considered
based on significant occurrence of the specific mineral.' this is the examination which
my lord is taking place every time there
is a revision in fixation of mineral rates.
then, my lord kindly come to next, 130.
and that is where government's concern comes and that would
possibly persuade your lordships to treat the act itself as
a limitation, apart from 3 or 4 specific sections which i'll show.
because act is my lord, please bear in mind, providing
for development and regulation of minerals and once the field
is occupied by provisions which makes the development possible and regulation possible.
my lord, i will show some of the
judgments the regulation would also mean prohibiting taxation.
it could have been expressly provided under the act, a prohibition on taxation.
but that is not there. my lord, i will answer that question straight away.
it is not provided. it is not provided.
it is not provided but no statute my lord, to my knowledge, would
provide a negative provision that you, the state legislature, will not tax it.
it occupies the field and the resultant constitutional
effect is your power of tax is taken away.
i will come to that, my lord.
but i want your lordship and my ladyship
to see this, then i am coming to.
and i'm aware. whatever is the extent after section 2 is the extent of limitations.
yes. that's. i bow down. that is the correct position.
it's not that, it's controlled everything my lord, under the universe.
whatever is . what is beyond, what is provided, is the question now ?
correct. to answer that question, i'll have to necessarily go through this chronology.
yes. whether.
it is entirely your lordships discretion to accept it or not, but
your lordships must have the background, in which your lordships are examining
the question because this is a nine-judge combination and my lord, the
law laid down will have huge impact on the economy of the nation.
import-export policy of the nation, and the domestic production industry of the nation.
because these are all used in core manufacturing and other domestic industries.
and therefore, my lord, this was the position even when the constitution was free.
therefore, only entry where taxing power is subject to some limitation.
i know, i have to answer limitation, frowned where?
i'll answer that, but please see my lord.
section 9 has been the consultation is read into it.
why my lord, the state needs to impose any further levy
for augmenting revenue that is taken into consideration while fixing the royalty.
to answer her ladyship's query. my lord, again, i'm putting it in a different way.
there is no negative provision in the state.
in the act that state legislature is denuded of the power.
because no legislative drafting would have such a provision.
negative provision is not required. how, my lord, that negative provision is ensured?
that part is implied according to you.
no. it's implied. by occupying the field.
if i am sitting on the chair, dr.
singhvi cannot sit on this chair, by occupying the.
we don't think that he will do that.
no, the question is. mr. solicitor, we don't think that he will do that.
we don't think he will even attempt to do that.
so, my lord, i don't have to say that - 'no.
dr. singhvi will not sit in this chair.' i occupy the chair.
that's my answer. but the question is -'what is beyond the chair?
' the chair is not exhaustive of everything.
that's what i'm. there is something beyond the chair, which is not occupied.
i'll show, my lord.
when the fixation takes place, everything beyond the chair is also taken into consideration.
it is, my lord, as the chief justice said, it is a block.
it's all inclusive. mmdra is a complete code in itself.
when it provides for fixation of fiscal levy, it exhausts all fiscal levies.
that is my respectful submission. please come to my lord, para 4.4, that is 131.
and this is what would be the problem, if india
cement is to be disturbed and kesoram is to be.
i'm not worried about india cement or kesoram.
i'm on a larger. i'm before a larger bench, my lord.
neither of the judgment binds. i'm sorry.
131 para 4.4. this is very crucial.
'indian mining sector is carrying the burden of highest taxation in the world. the
effective tax rate, for example, in case of iron one. iron ore works out
to be as high as 64% in case of the mines granted before 12th
january '15 and 60% in case of the new mines granted after 11 january.
' your lordship knows, in 2015, auction regime took place.
otherwise, it used to be first come, first served, et cetera.
'against this high incidence of taxation prevailing in the country, the internationally effective
tax rate is in the range of 31% to 45% as depicted in
the table given at the end of the chapter. the mining sector in
india is heavily taxed, and not only in comparison to international level.' please mark this.
'but also, in comparison to other domestic sectors. the taxation regime for mining
in india affects all downstream industries and employment opportunities in the country. while
fuelling the already skewed balance of payment through additional import of minerals here.
hence, there is a need to rationalize the
taxation structure.' they do not say mine royalty.
they are rationalizing the taxation structure on minerals.
'taxation structure for the mining sector, for sustainable development, and
deriving long term benefits in terms of sustained raw material
security for the industries.' we can't exhaust everything in 10 years.
but our structure should be such that, it competes with several factors.
then they have gone to effective tax rate.
'value of all amounts paid to the government.' please, mark this.
kindly underline the word 'all'.
'value of all amounts paid to the government and divided by total
revenue from mineral sales.' please my lord come to the next page.
mainly they have given mineral producing countries and compared with indian position.
mongolia is 31.30% effective tax rate.
similarly, canada, et cetera, et cetera, last two
are india new mines, that is after 2015, 59.84%.
and old mines - 63.97%.
this is the taxation structure as compared to global and this
includes all, everything which is payable to the government, including royalty.
so, they are deciding the fiscal structure, not royalty only, keeping in mind every
fiscal levy which is permissible or impermissible except what is quoted at the bottom.
'etr does not include a number of other payments, such as auction price.'
now after 2015, i have to participate, and i'll have to pay premium.
'auction price, purchase of land for mining, gst at 18%,
10% tax levied by supreme court.' it's a wrong word.
not 'levied by the', 'levied under.' under the order.
levied under the judgment. judgement. that's right.
levied under the judgment of the supreme court.
'levied by the supreme court in goa and karnataka and fdt
levied by karnataka as well as highest rate of royalty on
iron ore in odisha.' because they are imposing their own levies.
odissa and karnataka are imposing their own levies.
that is also considered. that is not considered.
still, still, this is the high level of taxation.
'net present value in case of survey in forest land.' i'm not going into details.
'net present value is 4.38 lakhs to 10.43 lakhs per hectare depending on density
of forest at the time of grant of lease.' then compensatory afforestation, et cetera.
now, please come to the next page where the total fiscal payment is decided.
'one of the main objectives of the study group as laid
down in terms of reference is to review and suggest changes
in the second schedule to the mmdr act.' second schedule contains the royalty.
'regarding the royalty rates keeping in view, the objective of mineral development.' please see this.
this is an exercise in the interest of mineral
development, which is a field occupied by the centre.
because they are not only deciding what amount will get to which state?
they are examining how the national development in the sector of minerals will take place.
how would we regulate the mineral sector and
mining sector in a fashion that it is developed.
so, this amount is under the act providing for development of minerals.
then your lordships may kindly see 5.2.
'the study group had a series of meetings on so and
so and so at hyderabad for deliberating the methodology to be
adopted. in depth analysis of international and domestic demand supply scenario
price trends of principal commodities.' because they use raw material, minerals as raw materials.
'review of taxation and fiscal regime.' please mark this.
'and fiscal regime and engagement with all stakeholders to formulate the final
recommendations of the study group.' this exercise is undertaken at the cost
of repetition every three years or four years, whenever there is a revision.
then your lordship, may kindly come to the next page, para 5.5.
they prepared questionnaires, two questionnaires, one sent to affected parties, that
is, mining industry and second to the state governments so as
to decide how the final figure is to be arrived at.
para 5.5.
'the questionnaires were also circulated for seeking information from the stakeholders with regard to
the criteria for fixing rate of royalty preference for ad valorem basis or tonnage
basis for charging royalty on minerals, periodicity of revision of royalty, perception of the
state government for the revenue earned for the imposition of royalty, utilization of royalty
for infrastructure development, environment protection, guidelines on charging of royalty, guidelines for computing royalty
on minerals on ad valorem basis. separate entry for so and so and so
and so. now, kindly see next page. 'new factors
since last revision of royalty rates and dead rent.
' because 2015 regime, that is the auction regime, steps in.
'after the notification of royalty rates and dead rent in september
2014, there have been major changes in the legal framework by
way of effecting the mmrd act with effect from 12th january
'15th as per the amendments, mining leases are to be granted through auction.
' your lordships can skip that and kindly come to the next page.
'criteria for determining royalty rates.' 5.9. your lordships gets 5.9?
'in determining the royalty rate for minerals, the study group assessed the following parameters.
grant of concession through auction mechanism and imposition of contribution to dmf plus nmet
leading to hefty revenue generated for the states.' kindly pause here for a minute.
now, there is a new insertion that is 9(c)
under which every mining operator will have to pay 30%.
of the royalty to the state which is being used, for the purpose
of mining affected persons and environment, not for general welfare of the people
and my lord, this national is minimal, but that comes to the centre.
'then impact of high burden of taxation, especially in comparison to international mining
jurisdictions.' this can never be done at the state level in a fragmented way.
it has to be at the federal level.
then 'dependence on imports of minerals'.
my lord, sometimes what happens is, some mining leaseholders, they stop
mining, which is required for core industries as a raw material,
so the country is dependent upon the import of the minerals.
that is considered that we will have to fix the fiscal structure in such
a way that import is minimum and we use the domestic production at the optimum.
and my lord the prices go high.
prices of the end product goes high.
if we import the minerals, to be used as a raw
material, the end product in the core industry sector will go high.
that is the concern which can never be done at the state level.
then, my lord - 'sluggish growth of mineral sector
and declining trends of its shares in country's gdp.
trends in domestic production and export quantities and prices of minerals.
' this is also considered that you are less incentivized
to export your minerals and give it to your domestic users.
'cost of mineral production, cost of transportation and handling charges,
implication of revision of royalty rates on revenue realization of
the state government and in the industry.' please see this, my lord.
'unused stocks of low grade, et cetera.' your lordship can skip.
next page only 2 paras, 5.12. and 5.13.
'one of the objectives of the study group is to devise
a royalty regime which is effective, transparent, stable, and is attractive
to the investors to invest in the mining sector, particularly for
mineral like copper, gold, silver and diamond.' they are using the word revenue.
royalty.
but they say that our attempt is to ensure that more and
more investors come, and that results in development of mines and minerals.
my lord, that is the scheme, that is the architecture of the act.
then - 'view of the stakeholders. the study group has tried to
obtain the view of stakeholders et cetera.' now, my lord may kindly
see, i'm just giving my lord overview of how this exercise progress.
please come to page 138. now my lord, they take 1 mineral.
'view of the stakeholders. 'the first stakeholder for this particular mineral is ministry of steel.
can never happen if it is fragmented state wise.
please see, 'was of the view that currently india has the highest rate
of royalty on iron ore. that is 15% of average sale value amongst
major iron ore producing countries and thereby having highest taxes at 64% of
effective tax rate. ministry of steel made the following recommendations.' i'm not going into it.
then please see (b) government of andhra pradesh.
the main recommendation, please see (b) -'increase of royalty rate to 4% from existing
2% on ad valorem basis for limonite, colemanite, so and so and so and so.
' they take into consideration what fiscal benefit we want to
derive out of the mineral wealth which we have in our country.
and therefore, they make a request. and they give justifications.
and acceptance and rejection of request are answered in this report, with reasons.
please see, my lord, then my lord.
then, please see next page, my lord.
government of andhra pradesh, iron ore. they say this.
please see my lord. continue. iv. your lordships have iv?
yes.
'continue existing rate of royalty for iron ore 15% of
average sale price on ad valorem basis, irrespective of the
grade of the ore.' they say, our coffers would be enough.
if we get this much out of our mineral wealth.
then my lord, they say that- 'to introduce 2 new
price for the low-grade iron or etc.' i'm not reading individually.
i'm saying that - 'every state represents, that you are deciding the fiscal
receipt which my state will get. please increase this. please bifurcate this. please
decrease this et. cetera, et cetera.' my lord, (c) is government of chhattisgarh.
i'm not reading. (d) is government of gujarat.
they have their own views. i'm not reading.
(e) is government of jharkhand. i'm not reading.
these are just examples, that every state participated, per mineral.
my lords, this is an exercise 'per mineral.' because every mineral has its
own economic parameters, and every mineral will have different stakeholders contributing their suggestions.
then, please see (f) government of madhya pradesh.
'the rate of royalty on diamond should be increased from 11.5% to
15%.' they say that -'we want something more from our diamond deposits.
' because madhya pradesh seems to be a diamond-rich state, my lord.
then government of odisha, government of telangana.
then kindly come to. my learned friend wants me to see.
show your lordships, telangana.
'it was highlighted by government of telangana, that the fixation of royalty should be
based on unit or volume instead of ad valorem, mainly for adequacy, administrative efficiency,
revenue stability, transparency and simplicity in monitoring royalty collections and reconciliation.' this is important.
'it was also pointed out, that the present royalty regime, that
is royalty dmf, that is district fund and national fund et
cetera imposes higher tax burden on mining sector and is high
comparatively with other countries relating to effective tax rate.' they say that -'decrease this.
' because internationally, there is a low tax regime.
we have higher tax.
and their concern is, they might lose the industries which are using this particular mineral.
so, they have their own concern. then my lord, next is fimi.
fimi is my lord, federation of indian mining industries.
they have also participated. but i'm not reading it, but this is a stakeholder participation.
now your lordships, may go by one or two examples of the minerals.
page 148, para 6.4.
this is how the development and regulation of mineral, is taken care of.
as a general architecture.
6.4 -'an analysis of the feedback given by the state government show
that, principal mineral producing state perceives royalty primarily as a source of
revenue as well as consideration for permitting exploitation of state mineral resources.
these states are also of the view that royalty is a consideration
due to the state government for allowing exploitation of its mineral resources,
beside a tool of source of fund for local area and community development.
' they say -'whatever figures we are suggesting is for our development.
' it goes in consolidated funds of india.
it's not for growth of mining industry only, it's their revenue generation.
it's like income tax by the central government.
it goes in the consolidated fund of india.
this goes in the consolidated fund of the state.
then my lord, the state governments in general gave priority for increasing
the revenue earnings from royalty as criteria for fixing the rates of royalty.
further, the state sought to consider optimum utilization of low-grade mineral resources.
fiscal measures for attracting investment please i am sorry.
fiscal measures for attracting investment and mineral conservation
as other important criteria for fixing royalty rates.
some states are also of the view that criteria of fixing
the royalty should be to attract improved technology to bring royalty
rates in tune with international rates for encouraging investment in mining sector.
' they are saying that this is an all-comprehensive package, which we are deciding.
'ficci recommends that differential rates of royalty should be charged
on intermediate minerals, et cetera, et cetera.' we are not concerned.
now, please see my lord, one example, kindly come to dead rent.
and i'll again show why how this is
a limitation, how this helps development and regulation.
what is dead rent? let us, see conceptually what is dead rent?
i have a mine.
i am not operating the mine, for whatever
reason, so i'll have to pay that rent.
that is the dead rent. why do we charge that as a concept?
it's not merely to incentivize them, incentivize the
mine owner to continuously mine and produce minerals.
there is one more important factor. and that important factor is this.
your lordships are aware that mineral resources of the country are limited.
they will be depleted and they are to be exploited in a phased manner.
when i get the lease, i get the lease with a condition
that i would extract minerals over a period of 10 years for
sustainable development to ensure that the simultaneously, the ecology is not harmed et cetera.
suppose i am greedy, or for whatever reason there are some market forces.
the price of that mineral has shot up, instead of 10 years
i deploy more manpower, more machinery and more equipment and do everything,
if i have to extract 5000 tons, i do it in 3 years.
i would be harming the environment; i would be harming the sustainable development.
and therefore, for 7 years, my dead rent would be
so high, that i am disincentivized to do in 3 years.
this is development of minerals.
therefore, i say the entire act is a consolidated, self-contained
code for every aspect of development and regulation of mineral.
this number 2, the example which i have given.
i'm sorry. yes. another one.
why dead rent and how it is directly
linked with the development and regulation of mineral?
every section has this theme.
suppose i do something in 3 years which i'm supposed to do in 10 years.
it would directly impact the price structure therefore, a provision for dead rent.
each and every provision has been our ultimate goal of development and regulation.
but i am showing this to show, that every state also comes
before the government saying that this is the all in all package
for my fiscal benefit, and this is how you decide the package.
my lord, 58. just giving an example how this exercise is undertaken per mineral.
this is not a general exercise per mineral global analysis.
stakeholders are asked. stakeholders give their details, their desire.
global analysis.
now for bauxite, after considering each state's request
for increase, decrease change, in methodology, et cetera.
the committee goes into, the global analysis.
'aluminium industry is the principal consumer of bauxite. world production of aluminium was 58
million tons in 2015. china continued to be the leading producer with a share
of about 54%, which is followed by russia, canada and uae and india. 4%
each. global aluminium demand of so and so and so forth.' i am not
reading everything but they examined the global scenario qua bauxite, keeping in mind the
demand, request or desire of every state government for
their generation of fiscal revenue and 163 is the conclusion.
yes, my lord. kindly see my lord.
'keeping in view the global consumption production trend analysis of global royalty rates, increase
in production cost, and future domestic demand.' kindly see the parameters they are considering.
this can be considered only at the national level.
'that production cost has gone high. future domestic demand. the study group
recommends that royalty rate for metallurgical grade bauxite be reduced to 0.45%
of lme prices so that net impact, including dmf and nmet remains
the same as 0.60%.' please mark, 'net impact', including two statutory levies under the mmdra.
i hope i am able to make myself clear.
these two.
dmf is one of the funds created under 9(c) and nmet is
a fund created under 9(e), so they say - 'royalty, dmf and
nmet considering that the net impact is only . 6%.' and net
impact would mean whatever you wanted is given or not given for a reason.
but you cannot levy anything more. constitutionally, i will answer.
how can we say that? but this is how the exercise takes place.
we're just by 194, my lord. i'll not read this.
i can assure your lordship, i'll not read this.
but for limestone. cess et cetera. which is not a tax.
and royalty, in any case is not a tax.
that's not the issue i am right now raising.
please see limestone at page 194. 193.
i'm not reading it, my lord, but every state had different justifications for increase,
decrease, increase, decrease, but eventually the committee, after taking into consideration, everything at page 194.
my lord may see the bottom, then i'm through.
then i'm done with this.
'after analysis of data on cement price for the last 2 years impact
of limestone as raw material cost and its significance for infrastructural growth. the
study group recommends to adjust royalty rate of ld grade limestone to rs.
70 from rs. 90 per ton and other grade limestone to rs. 60
from 80 per ton. so that the impact of dmf and nmet gets
cushioned and absorbed for auctioned mines only.' meaning thereby only three levies are being contemplated.
the reason is this, my lord, limestone is directly used for manufacturing of
cement and cement is required for the core infrastructural growth of the country.
what they say is, we will have to cushion in these two charges, meaning
thereby, it's very clear that they are providing for all-inclusive fiscal benefit to each state.
are the states told by the study group at any point
that -'look, in lieu of your tax revenue what is it
that you require by way of total revenues to be generated.
so that we will take royalty fixed.
we will take into account your overall loss of taxing revenues.
' does that exercise happen?
we find only that they have said, well to cushion the payment of dmf
and nmet the reduction of rates of royalty in certain cases have been recommended.
because after 2015 amendment they have to pay to the
national mineral, the district mineral fund and the exploration trust.
district fund. right.
but is there anything here to indicate that the states are told that -
'well, what is it that your revenue generation requirements are? therefore, when we fix
the royalty, we will take into account your loss of tax revenues.' page 148.
if your lordships can come to. there are 6.4.
you're right. but throughout the study report, the study groups report.
they keep on saying that -'look, we have to
cushion the impact of the dmf and the nmet.
' meaning. therefore, because of the dmf, the states are getting this additional levy.
the investor has to pay extra, so that we
will cushion that impact by reducing the rate of royalty.
meaning thereby, nothing else. otherwise, there is no question of cushioning.
even they are going to the extent.
'nothing else' is the key. where do you get that actually?
i will come to that. just answering your lordship's question.
we saw that. everywhere they are trying to cushion the impact of dmf, nmet.
my lord, if your lordships are looking at
a specific, negatively worded provision, there is none.
that, nothing else. these and nothing else.
because legislature do not use such language, but not for another legislature.
a negative language. they occupy the field and i'll show the field is occupied.
only to the extent provided. exactly. i'll show the extent.
your ladyship is right. i'll show to what extent it is providing.
in fact,. it appears to be, if you compute the effective rate of tax.
the effective rate of tax, is the total amount which
is paid to the state, divided by way of royalty
and other levies, divided by the total realizations on account of sale.
when we see that this effective rate of tax is very high
in india, and therefore the royalty rates have to be so modulated.
that would, in my submission necessarily mean, that if you put any
other burden, the balance at the national and international level will be disturbed.
that's the only similar.
answering my lord, the chief justice's query, my lord, please come to
pdf 136, 'criteria for determining royalty rates.' your lordship gets it, my lord?
can i read? my lord, kindly come to (f) and (g).
(f). my lord, i'm not reading the rest.
first see (b), for instance, impact of high burden
of taxation, especially in comparison to international mining jurisdiction.
so does this not really therefore, seem to contemplate that,
there is a duty to pay tax to the states.
the burden is high.
no, no. and therefore, we are fixing the royalty to modulate the burden of taxation.
no. my lord, the impact of high burden of taxation would mean, that,
as per the global phenomena, our fiscal regime, my lord, i'll use a
general, i'll use a neutral word, that our fiscal regime has high taxation.
but, therefore my lord, i had shown to you
your lordships, what it includes and what it doesn't include.
my lord, please, for a second, my lord, just to answer my
lord, come back to my lord, that high taxation part, value of.
mr. sg, the query of our chief justice was.
yes.
the very fact that clause (b) refers to, high burden of
taxation, it itself contemplates that states will continue to levy taxes,
and that will be taken into consideration while fixing the royalty.
my lord, i am answering that. my lord, please come to, 132.131.
i'm sorry, 131.
as you rightly said, royalty, though fixed by the
union is entirely appropriated, levied and appropriated by these states.
right?
now, therefore, when they are fixing royalty, they are fixing the price, which
the states will realize, by the extraction of minerals of which they are owners.
right? that's the whole concept of royalty.
also, dead rent, because you don't expect you have to pay dead rent.
now while fixing the royalty, which is a realization by the states for the
extraction of minerals, the study group looks at what the state is already realizing
on account of taxation, and it in fact says, that because there is such
a high burden of taxation, which the states are imposing, therefore we will modulate
the royalty accordingly, which postulates again, that taxation is something which the states are imposing.
in fact, it's not the other way.
but look, we are increasing the rate of royalty to
a level, so that you will exclude all other levies.
that's not the approach of the study group.
my lord, can i answer? my lord, there is an answer.
there are two answers. please come to, my lord, page 131 at the foot.
131. nor are they fixing royalty, to compensate for the loss of tax revenues.
it's there, my lord. i'm showing that.
my lord, your lordship, can you just bear with me?
page 131. 131? 131. how, my lord, the effective tax rate is calculated.
131. bottom. your lordship gets? yes.
value of all amounts paid to the government by the miner.
mr. solicitor, this goes against you.
if effective rate, if the numerator in the
effective rate of tax, were to be paid.
were be the value of all amounts paid to the
government on account of royalty, then you would be right.
no, no. kindly. they factored in all payments which are made to the state.
we try and read in that way.
but, kindly read it the other way, that everything which the.
one thing is clear.
because the product of this division, the numerator and the
denominator is so high, in the case of india, almost 60%.
therefore, they wanted to impose a more realistic royalty
regime by, in fact, reducing the rate of royalty.
can i answer that? can i answer?
first and foremost, when this report is prepared,
kesoram holds the field and therefore there were levies.
there are levies, so that cannot be ignored by the study group, correct, my lord?
after kesoram, the state is imposing levies in some states.
it's 500% of that of the royalty.
so, it says, value of all amounts paid to the government.
please my lord, now turn the page.
that would get the answer of what the chief justice hold.
india 59 and. 59 and. that's okay, but note.
what it does not include.
first, he said 'everything which is paid to the government.' but accept this,
my lord, please see - 'etr that is effective tax rate does not
include a number of other payments, such as auction price, purchase of land
for mining, gstf 18%, 10% tax levied by the supreme court, net present
value in case of survey, net present value, compensatory afforestation, upfront payment at
the time of grant of mining lease.' but it therefore does not include.
it does not exclude the state cesses, it includes the state cesses.
you may be right because of the prevalence of kesoram because
when the study report came, you were in the kesoram regime.
the states can levy cess.
but the fact remains that this study group postulates that the
rate of royalty would be so modulated so that the amount
which is realized by the state's towards royalty is adequately reduced
to factoring the higher rate of taxes, which the states are otherwise imposing.
would your lordships come to a two-page thereafter one.
5.9. there are 5.9.
methodologically, the study group is not saying that -'look, we
are now going to give you an adequate realization by
way of royalty, so that you do not impose any other levies.
' that's not what they are telling the states.
136, if your lordships come to.
on the other hand, this exclusion clearly states that there
are other types of exactions which the states can do.
for example, in karnataka.
forest development tax, or fdt, is levied on forest produce, which also includes mineral resources.
that is the question, my lord whether it can be levied or not?
that's the question whether it can be levied.
but that's the question. it is levied.
in every state under some name or the other, it is being levied.
but, my lord, my reading of this page
131 is that how tax rate is derived?
all, whatever you are supposed to pay, state tax, royalty, district fund, national fund, everything.
multiplied by this, except a, b,c, d, e, which does not include, the exceptions
or deductions do not take care of state and apropos your lordships query, please
come to page 136, whether it is considered
or not that, what is your revenue requirement?
point (g).
i stopped at 5 (f), my lord but please see (g) -'implication of
revision of royalty rates on revenue realization of the state government and the industry.
' this is inclusive. from royalty. there are always two ways of reading it.
but what they say is that what will be the implication
on the overall growth of this and how it would impact?
i don't wish to take your lordships through every mineral- wise discussion what they
say is- 'this is the total amount which a miner pay, this mineral is
used in abcd industry. this is the position in the global market. and if
we do not put the cap of total fiscal payment at particular point, it
would be against the development of the mining industry.' that is how they are approaching.
the difficulty for me is,. my lord, after.
i'll come to the act immediately.
but apropos this query, my lord, after india cement, when the state was not
permitted to levy anything other than royalty, they were compensated by the respective study
group by increasing royalty, so it is always considered as 'a composite receipt by
the state.' please, my lord, come to volume v. only one paragraph, page 1569.
my lord, this is that mahalakshmi judgment state of m.p. versus mahalakshmi fabrics.
so, when you are not levying the other charges, the compensatory.
volume v, right? yes, volume v, page 1569.
it starts at 1561 my lord, but i am
pointedly inviting your lordship's attention to the relevant part.
pdf is 1575. i'm sorry, my lord.
1575. left side pdf page. 1567? your lordship gets, my lord?
left hand side, my lord, pagination 1575.
pdf pagination, my lord getting that? yes.
the first.
'the controversy ultimately came to be decided by this court in orissa cement versus
state of orissa, whereby, such cess was held to be invalid and beyond the
legislative competence of the state government. it appears that soon after the aforesaid invalidation
of the cess, the coal producing states were faced with problem of refunding the
amounts obtained by them that far. they, therefore approached the central government for help.
in pursuance to the state approach, parliament passed an act validating the cess.' so
that, they don't have to repay it to the government, repay it to the miners.
'we are not concerned. we are not concerned with the said ordinance and subsequent
act in the present proceedings. it appears.' please note this, 'that since the state
government had suffered financial losses because of the invalidation of cess, they also approached
the central government for help in the matter. as a consequence, thereof, a working
group was constituted in this behalf. the said working group suggested an increase in
the royalty to the extent of 17% per ton of coal. the working group
also found sufficient justification for compensating the coal producing states to the extent of
100% of the loss caused by the aforesaid judgment of this court. since the
recommendation was accepted by the central government, the impugned notification was issued by the
government, according to the writ petitioner before the high court. the increase in the
rates of royalty pursuant to the notification was to the extent of 4400% to
2000% as compared to the royalty fixed in 1981 on various varieties of coal.
it was further contended, etc.' my lord, the point i'm making is, when they
were prevented from taking any levy, that loss was compensated in the fixation of royalty.
and when they are now permitted to levy because of kesoram and
subject to what your lordship decides, the royalty is so fixed that,
it also takes into account that you are already earning this much.
because thus. this subgroup cannot seek in appeal, whether it is leviable or not.
they will have to proceed, that as on date it is leviable.
you are earning rs. 100.
in other words, the fixation of royalty is not agnostic
to what the states are realizing by way of taxation.
because of kesoram. yes. therefore, my lord, therefore this reference.
it's just that the states are entitled to demand something in
way of tax, and they adjust the royalty every three years.
now, my lord, what would happen? in practical terms, what would happen?
if, your lordships, hypothetically were to hold that the state had
no jurisdiction, competence, state legislature had no competence, to levy a
particular levy other than royalty, dead rent, rent and my lord.
the thing that the government of india will increase royalties.
exactly. because that will, somewhere we will have to have, a national perspective.
my lord, we will have to have national perspective keeping in mind the
global scenario, and this exercise cannot be left to, my lord, the provincial interest.
narrow provincial interest. narrow, i'm not using it in a bad sense.
but when i am deciding for one particular state,
my lord, my examination would be a narrow examination.
i would not take a holistic national approach and in
any case, i cannot take a global factor into consideration.
see, if a state is so foolish, as to tax.
imposes at such high rates, obviously the market will provide for greater imports.
if there is a greater amount of imports, the states will lose
their revenue because there will be no demand for locally produced minerals.
my lord, the nation lose this.
my lord, when import increases, that's exactly what my lord, i'm driving at.
that if the domestic production is less because of high taxation, the import starts.
that's what we are my lord, avoiding.
we want. only give me a minute.
the state will never want to be in a situation where,
by overpricing, the overtaxing the products, it will start losing its revenues.
because if it overprices the product, it's also
a matter for demand and supply for the state.
if it overprices the tax paid, if it overcharges, you know,
obviously there'll be a greater incentive to import as you are
rightly saying, in which case it will impact upon the state revenues.
my lord, sometimes suppose they undercharge it, they undercharge it and start exporting.
my lord, the idea is that national levels, on the national
level, a holistic decision is taken that our minerals, which are
our national resource, are used for domestic production of infrastructure and
core industries, and therefore this is one way of controlling import or export.
what you are trying to show is, exercise done once.
no. every three years it's done. no, it is very slightly different.
i'm sorry.
we are not considering how the royalty is being fixed by the central government.
we are considering only a very simple issue, whether power to impose royalty is
itself sufficient to draw an inference that states are denuded from the power under.
please come to the act, my lord.
i know, my lord, that's the hard.
suppose, in a given case tomorrow, central government says that
-'we want to impose royalty of, say, only rs. 10.
' they have a power to impose royalty of rs. 10.
so can you say that in the states can't levy the tax.
in a given fact situation for a particular year, the government may
have undertaken this exercise, of talking to the states, taking their feedback.
we are really on the question whether only because there's a
power to levy royalty, that power of state to pay taxes is.
my lord, i'm answering that immediately. factually, this is not a one time exercise.
this is an exercise done whenever there is a revision of
royalty, that is every 3 years, sometimes, my lord, for 5 years.
so, this is how the section 9 is read.
the consultation is read into section 9.
that is one.
consultation with the state to arrive at a consolidated figure is read into this.
now, please see section. metaphorically, just taking from what brother oka was.
my lord, my respectful submission, taking the example metaphorically, as the lordships said.
for example. yes, my lord.
if my intention is to occupy it exclusively, then he is ousted.
apropos my lord's concern and a very valid concern that
market forces can itself arrive at a particular decision making.
for example, your lordship said -give me a minute to
answer that state if overcharges, then state would not get
the revenue and therefore, market forces would ultimately settle down the issue.
that takes a very long time, when we rely upon market
forces to settle down an issue, the damage is done, and
this is damage about our national resources and damage would be national level.
the mistake would be or whatever decision would be of
a state, my lordships are examining this as a federal issue.
to use brother rishikesh roy's example, your submission
is that because i am occupying my chair.
dr. singhvi is ousted from occupying his chair.
no. i'm sorry, my lord. i'm sorry, only a minute.
i'm sorry. i would answer.
my lord my submission is, there is only one chair
in the room which i am occupying with an intention
of ensuring that nobody else, including dr. singhvi, occupies the chair.
there are no two chairs here. your lordships' example pre-supposes two chairs.
i am saying, there is entry 54.
50 says if there is a law under 50, you are out.
so, there is a law under 50, the field is occupied,
and there is only one field that is mineral development and.
regulation and development of mineral.
so, my metaphoric example was, when there is only one chair and i occupy
the chair with an intention of excluding others, and i am giving my lord.
why i gave all these because i have to show public interest.
it's not just that state, centre wants to act like a big brother.
there is a public interest involved, my lord as 54, entry 54 stipulates.
my law is not just for development and regulation,
to oust or to be treated as a limitation.
it must be in public interest also.
that's what i was showing.
that why this has to be done at a national
level and not at provincial level with some narrow considerations weighing.
your lordships are right, sometimes a wrong decision by a state to overprice
may damage the state, and after 3 or 4years, the state may come down.
but what happens within that 3-4 years?
that's the question my lord which will have to be asked.
one other perspective is in the context of royalty, the central act or the
parliament is permitting the states to levy royalty, but what is the limitation imposed on.
not levy? no, parliament doesn't permit me to levy.
the state is levying the royalty under the central act.
it's not centre which is levying the royalty.
no. my lord. i am only fixing the rate.
correct. that is the only limitation on the rate.
no. my submission is, now examine that submission.
my submission is . royalty, the states or centre?
state. so, parliament is enabling the states to collect royalty?
yes. but the limitation is only on the rate of royalty, correct.
so that is a constitutional limitation in the context of entry 50.
that is their submission that the. no, no under the act.
i have to yet to convince your ladyship, their
submission is that section 9 is the only limitation.
and since section 9 does not prohibit other
levy, we can have law providing for other levy.
that submission is wrong. that's the main dispute.
you are going to go to the act now, i suppose?
kindly come to the statement of objection reasons.
'the differentiation made between petroleum and other minerals in item 53 and 54 of
the union list has rendered separate enactments for the two necessary. the present bill
deals only with minerals other than petroleum. at present, both are dealt with under
the mines and minerals.' that is the old
act and my lord, your lordships can skip.
nothing would turn. come to my lord the preamble.
'an act to provide for.' provide for what, my lords?
'development and regulation of mines and minerals, under the control of the union.'
so, the act provides that the entire act take within its control, mine.
the development and regulation.
whatever is necessary for development and regulation of mine is now under our control.
your lordship is right. section 2 says -'to the extent below.
' i'm conscious of it.
2 - 'declaration as to expediency of the union control: it is hereby declared,
that, it is expedient in public interest.' to borrow my lord, expression from entry
54, 'that union should take, under its control, the regulation of mines and the
development of minerals, to the extent, hereinafter provided.'
now, my lord, it provides for 3 things.
the first, is 'reconnaissance'.
i want to show that entire universe, so far as mineral regulation and development
is concerned, is now covered by this, and therefore, there is an occupied field.
but reconnaissance would mean, without touching the soil, by satellite imaging or
whatever, one would first decide whether there is any mineral in the land?
second, would be 'prospecting of mineral'.
so, there is a prospecting license regime, where you
excavate just to find out, whether there is any mineral?
sometimes you are trying to find out 'a' mineral and you find 'b' mineral.
there is a provision made.
then you have to surrender your lease and give it to the government back.
if instead of uranium, something else is found.
and third, is 'actual mining.' all these three.
there are two separate chapters under the act.
one, dealing with 'regulation of mines' and another dealing with 'development of mines.'
and my respectful submission would be that these two chapters read with other provisions.
i have started with the act my lord.
can i start after lunch my lord?
it's five minutes. so that with continuity, my lord, your lordships can.
how long would you now take, mr. solicitor?
one more session. less than that, my lord, but i'll.
we had given one day for everybody to conclude, actually.
we have relied upon your lordship's kindness.
alright. but i think. there is a rule of estoppel.
everybody should conclude by lunch tomorrow, i think.
that will be a very fair. isn't.
it? by lunch tomorrow, everybody now. by tomorrow.
by tomorrow. we have to close tomorrow.
we have regular. my lord, i would say something.
we are before a 9-judges bench.
any lacuna on our part in assistance, even for the other side
i would request that, if there are 2 counsels, let both give the.
and one more thing, my lord. i am going to.
i'm going to be doing without prejudice, alternative argument.
your lordship, accept these arguments, matter ends.
your lordship doesn't accept these arguments. not going to.
my lord, what your lordships would. give it to me. all right.
after now, the solicitor general concludes, i think
everybody can take 20 minutes, 20 minutes each.
and then. i would invoke. it's more of a good thing, now, i think.
my lord, i would invoke the doctrine of legitimate expectation and estoppel.
your lordship cannot cease to be kind.
kindly my lord, take entry 50 for a minute my lords.
during lunch hours something my lord to assist your lordships
and answering the query, very pertinent questions your lordships have put.
my lord, this is my respectful submission, entry 50 'taxes
on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by parliament'.
now, this is kindly mark, by law relating to mineral development.
what possibly we are reading right now is under a law relating to mineral development.
we are searching for a specific section in a law relating to mineral development.
in this context, please read it again, my lord, 'taxes on mineral rights,
subject to any limitations imposed by parliament by law relating to mineral development'.
there is a law relating to mineral development.
my lord, there would not be any negatively worded section prohibiting another legislature from taxing.
the word relating to mineral development, do they qualify limitations or law?
law my lords. made by parliament by law relating to mineral development.
right.
so, limitation will have to be found in the law,
not my lord limitation imposed by a section of the law.
but it has to be a limitation in the law.
correct, my lords. limitation has to be there in the law.
no, no, not in the law.
that's where my lord, i think the other side is wrong.
by law. by parliament, by law. by law.
what we are reading is. who should impose the limitations?
parliament, the source should be parliament. correct.
what is the source to be found in?
in the law.
and what is the law, content of the law relating to mineral development.
kindly now. kindly read the way they would like it to be read.
according to my understanding imposed by parliament, in law relating to mineral development.
we have a law relating to mineral development.
in that law where is the limitation?
which section provides for limitation?
so basically, three things, who, how and in
what methodology of, who, how and about what?
who? by parliament. how? by law. about what?
law relating to mineral development. i am grateful, but not in law.
that you have a law relating to mineral development.
what is that in law? in that law.
no. but that law must really authorize, that law must impose limitations.
correct my lords.
but not from a particular section, which we are trying to find out.
that's the argument that even if there is no specific
limitation, the overall lay of the law so to say.
architecture of the law. architecture of the law that has been argued.
that's the point. before i take your lordships to the act.
and you go one step further. you are saying occupied field.
therefore, even if i don't impose any limitations, i occupy the whole field of limitation.
i don't think that you are arguing of.
which i will show to your lordships, that
anything and everything concerning mineral regulation and mineral development.
is an occupied field.
is taken into consideration by the parliament by
this law made for development and regulation of minerals.
that's my respectful submission. now let's see the provision?
before that, only one answer.
your lordships, a very pertinent example of, say electricity that some state may
enhance the rates of enhance the duty on electricity or levy on electricity.
i could not answer on that immediately, but thereafter i thought about it.
if one particular state increases the levy on electricity,
and the electricity is costlier, only that state will suffer.
but if the coal meets with the same treatment -- the coal is
required throughout the country for generation of electricity -- other states will suffer.
that is the distinction between minerals and other.
coal is just an example because your lordships
were pleased to give electricity, but any mineral.
if i overprice it in my state, the entire state suffers.
sorry. entire country suffers.
that's a question of federal balance, and that is how your lordships would
read an entry, that serves federal balance, public interest vis-a-vis the global phenomena.
now kindly see my lord the mineral.
since you have read the statute over and over again, just tell us
now which are the provisions of the statute which you want to emphasize.
yes, yes, my lord. section 2 i have read my lord.
please see my lord the title of section
4, the main chapter title, not the section title.
your lordships may have it in page 5.
if possibly we have the same. page 5.
your lordships have? general restrictions on undertaking prospecting and mining operations.
this chapter deals with restrictions. correct, my lord?
yes. now, 4 is prospecting or mining operations to be under license or lease.
it is governed covered by the central act.
you cannot do it. no person shall undertake any reconnaissance prospective.
that's okay. you need not read it.
we got the point. yes. now kindly see in this chapter, section 9.
the way my lord's queries were in the pre-lunch session your lordships, may
say that, may consider them or may say that there is no restriction.
9 is an enabling provision that you provide for the rates of royalty.
but there is no restriction.
but my respectful submission is, there would not be any parliamentary law
which would prohibit statute, prohibit an otherwise competent state legislature from legislating.
one has to read from the entries only.
if parliament in the total architecture. my lord, what is the total architecture?
then i'll come to only 2 sections.
total architecture is mines and minerals. there are two types.
major minerals and minor minerals. yes. minor minerals are localized products used locally.
its impact is not felt outside the state.
the act by statutory enactment leaves it to the state to govern.
kindly my lord allow me to repeat this, because this is the heart
of my submission, the mineral which has no impact outside the state, like
mines and mineral, sand, et cetera there are no limitations imposed by this act.
in fact, there is a permissive statutory provision
that you decide how to deal with it.
you grant the lease.
you decide how the royalty, the rate of royalty also will be
fixed by the state that is permissive statutory provision for minor minerals.
and it is done by the parliament by the law relating to mineral development.
kindly see the distinction.
that power conferred upon the state government regarding
minor minerals is not because of section 50.
i mean, entry 50 or entry 23.
i'm sorry my lord.
yes, my lord the power which is conferred upon the states for
minor minerals, my lord their source is not entry 23 or entry 25.
this act, which is passed under entry 54 delegates that
or leaves it open to them, that for minor minerals,
you deal with it, this act will not deal with it.
now after two minerals, two categories of minerals, so far as.
but minor minerals will fall within entry 23 of list ii.
pardon? entry 23 of list ii. i'm saying something else.
because minor minerals. because entry 23 is subject to entry 50.
the law made by the parliament that the state shall regulate.
it allows the states to regulate. unconceivably, we are not.
i'm saying something slightly different my lord.
i am sorry i was not clear.
out of the two categories of mineral, what the central act
ought to deal with all aspects is major minerals and not
minor minerals, because minor minerals do not have any intra-state implications.
right. and parliament chose not to occupy the field of minor minerals, right.
kindly see section 50. what i'm submitting is.
i'm sorry, before your lordship reads section 50.
what i am respectfully submitting. before your lordship sees section 50.
kindly allow me to preface this argument.
entry 23 permits the state government to make the law.
correct my lords? yes.
entry 50 permits the state government means state legislature
to make the law regarding taxation subject to this.
now please see 15.
power of state government to make rules in respect of minor minerals.
the state government may, by notification in the official gazette make rules for
regulating the grant of quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in
respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected there with and in particular.
my lord, please see 1(a)(g).
fixing and collection of rent, royalty fees, dead rent, fines, et cetera, et cetera.
the respectful submission which i made was, the field of minerals,
both major and minor, is occupied by this act, but by
section 15 this act delegates the powers qua minor minerals to the state.
right. so now, if we see the architecture and.
i'm sorry. yes. architecture and structure of the mmrda.
if the central government wants to provide for everything
concerning major minerals, my lord what would be the consideration?
what are the factors the state government will have to statutorily provide for?
(a), all kinds of licenses, reconnaissance, prospecting, actual mining, royalty, et cetera, et cetera.
my lord, every field is occupied by this act,
which is my lord, undisputably an act under 54.
so, the field of regulation and development is occupied by this act?
yes.
now my lord, may kindly come to a
section 13, but the title of section 30.
my lord, please come to section 13.
my lord, one thing that i consider your ladyship is, right to the
extent my lord, that's even if it is not mentioned, the limitation will
have to be to the extent of the scheme, according to me, and
as per my lord, other side, one section should be there, that you are prohibited.
that's the difference.
my lord, kindly see the title before -- title under which section 13 is placed.
rules for regulating the grants of prospecting licenses and mining leases.
this is how the regulation takes place under the scheme of the act.
and please see 13 my lord, power of
central government to make rules in respect of minerals.
the central government may, by notification in the official gazette make rules for regulating
the grant of mineral concession in respect of minerals and for purposes connected therewith.
please see my lord, (e), (f) and (i).
(e) utilization of coal or lignite, including mining for sale by a company.
the authority by which mineral concession in respect of
the land in which the mineral vests in the government.
straight away my lord, come to (i), fixing
and collection of fees for mineral concession surface rent.
please my lord, note this 'surface rent'.
it's a separate category, and therefore it can't be a land, or tax on land.
surface rent, security deposit, fines, other fees or charges and
the time within which, the manner in which and the
manner in which the dead rent or royalty shall be payable.
this is all which is leviable and payable, because
the act takes care of every aspect of major mineral.
that's my respectful submission. now please come to my lord, 18.
this will apply to all categories of minerals?
no. why? no, my lord, for minor minerals.
all major minerals, yes. that's what i said, it applies to all minerals.
yes, yes. all minerals. except minor. in fact, chapter 2, also applies to all minerals.
yes. in fact.
only rule making power is left to the state government, under rule 15.
no, no, no i'm sorry my lord.
rule making power in respect of minor minerals are left to the state government.
for minor mineral, yes, yes.
but all other provisions apply to both the categories of minerals.
correct, correct.
i was just looking at the definition of expression minerals it covers all mineral.
mineral includes all minerals. correct my lord.
except mineral oils. so, it's not that mineral includes all minerals except minor minerals.
minerals includes all minerals. all minerals my lord.
but for rule making power. they can make rules under section 15.
for minor my lords, but 13.
not only that, under section 14, it categorically says exactly i was coming to 14.
i'm obliged. they do not apply to minor minerals.
only 4 applies.
provisions of section 5 to 13 shall not apply to quarry
leases, mining leases or other mineral concession in respect of minor minerals.
these sections are not applicable. 4 is applicable.
4 is applicable, but the rules will be made.
who will grant lease? how to grant lease?
what will be the royalty? what will be the fee?
but according to my respectful submission, 13 (i) is
an all-inclusive provision which can be subjected to levy.
it can be fixing and collection of fees for mineral concession, surface
rent, security deposit, fines, other fees or charges, and the time within
which, the manner in which the dead rent or royalty shall be payable.
this is a statutory provision to be made by
the central government in exercise of its statutory rulemaking power.
now, please come to 18. i'll just show the title.
and only one thing. if you go to section 15.
yes. similar power is conferred on the state also rule making power.
correct for minor minerals. no, for royalty et cetera, also.
yes, correct. that's what i was submitting.
the legislature was dealing with two categories of minerals.
therefore, if you see clause number 'g'.
it authorizes state to frame rules for even collection of royalty.
correct but for minor minerals. yes, minor minerals yes, but that power is conferred.
i'm saying the same thing, that there are two minerals, major
and minor, for major the centre retained its control for minor
it is delegated to states except these five sections under section 14.
these rules for minor minerals, the parliament acquires and then delegates to the state.
that's all i am saying. major minerals only central government and only 'i'.
these are the entries, it closes.
it is all inclusive entry, that this is
all you can provide for and you can charge.
now your lordships may kindly come to 18.
just the title, 'development of minerals.' how do we
reconcile your argument with the debates in the constitution assembly?
when they decided that it should be kept this
power of taxation should be kept with the state.
i have the debates also in my note.
it should be brought in the union list?
they specifically said that it should be kept in the state.
yes, my subject to union prohibiting it.
correct my lord. i am not.
by your argument, this particular act, this is the only act.
parliament, this is the only act.
now this act talks about very many things and in case
of minor minerals, it talks about what is being given so
far as minor minerals is concerned the power to the state.
it could have also said that the power of taxation for minor minerals is given.
it's not said so. maybe that is derived from 50.
we have to see why it is not said so.
the parliament. 50. because of 50. they would tax under 50 because.
therefore, they have to tax? allow me to answer.
allow me to answer. that exactly i think your lordships are suggesting my point, inadvertently.
you're smart enough to take my point.
don't keep on .
50 says power of taxation subject to the limitation imposed by parliament by law.
now, this is the law. now that limitation is lifted for minor minerals.
it can tax for minor minerals.
so therefore, your argument is power of the state
to levy taxes on operations regarding minor minerals, is there.
that power is not taken away. i'm not disputing that.
it's nobody's case. they don't have or i am saying that.
no, i mean, they say that we haven't.
so therefore. we are on major minerals.
so, states can levy taxes. of course.
unless my lord, it is prohibited. it is not prohibited.
tomorrow, parliament can even prohibit. legally speaking.
why can't this logic apply, even to major minerals.
why can't this logic apply even to major minerals.
there's no distinction between the two. yes.
if your stand of the government of india is that.
your lordships may not ask me that question.
the answer is very simple.
the entire act controls major minerals and keeps minor mineral out of it.
no, no, no. it is applicable to minor minerals also.
correct my lord. so, for the -- what is section 4?
what is section.
it says that without license or a lease there can't be any mining operation.
correct my lords.
and kindly see 15 that what should be the
nature of the lease, et cetera, the state will decide.
your lordships have understood, i hope understood my proposition that
4 provides that without lease and license you will not.
kindly allow me to read. i'll just read first section.
section 4(1).
no person shall undertake any reconnaissance, prospecting or mining operations in any
area except under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
a reconnaissance permit or prospecting license or as the case may be,
of a mining list granted under this act or the rules made thereunder.
now this rule making power for minor mineral is 50.
it's delegated power. that's all i am saying.
now please come to 25. 18 title.
section 18, title, development of minerals. your lordships have seen first chapter regulation of minerals.
now development of minerals. only section 18 i will read.
it shall be the duty of the central government to take all such steps
as may be necessary for the conservation and systematic development of minerals in india.
my lord my power to fix uniform royalty flows from this.
systematic development of minerals in india and for the protection of environment
by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by prospecting
or mining operations, and for such purposes the central government may by
notification in the official gazette make such rules as it may think fit.
then there are rulemaking powers. correct? now please come to 25.
i may read it closely my lord, a little slowly.
the recovery of certain sums as arrears of land revenue.
any rent, royalty, tax or other sum due to the
government under this act, please mark the word under this act.
the centre has no taxing power under 54.
so far as mines and minerals are concerned state has no taxing power.
it can be traced only under 97.
this is a future contingency.
if for some reason in future it is required to invoke 97, that is
residuary entry for the purpose of taxing mineral because it is under this act.
initially, the reaction would be that tax means tax imposed by the state government.
no, it is tax imposed under this act.
the rent, royalty, tax fee or other sum due to the government
under this act or the rules made there under or under the
terms and conditions of any mineral concession may honour certification of such
officer as may be specified by the state government in this behalf
by general or special order be recovered in
the same manner as in the land revenue.
my lord, it provides, whose taxation is the
subject matter, the tax may impost under this act.
and who will exercise the powers, revenue officer.
why and whom at whose behest?
the state government, because states, in any case, collects the royalty.
there is no dispute about that fact.
so, my lord, this again.
my lord show that, tax, if at all or royalty,
et cetera, my lord, is the subject with the central government.
now your lordships, may kindly come to mineral concession rules?
my lord, please come to rule 31.
page number is same. my lord, maybe at page 65.
i did not say my lord, law relating to
mineral development would include statutory law, including delegated legislation.
the rules also would be law for the purpose of my lord, that entry.
please your ladyship may see rule 31.
now my lord, after showing the architecture, i am trying to take
your lordships' closer to something very specific my lord, 31, lease to
be executed within six months, where, on an application for the grant
of a mining lease, an order has been made for the grant
of such lease, a lease lead in form k, please mark this my lord.
form k my lord, is very, very crucial to
answer your lordships' question, where it is all inclusive.
form k, or in a form as near thereto a circumstance
of each case may require shall be executed within six months
of the order or within such further period, we are not concerned.
if it doesn't, then it lapses. we are not concerned.
now, please come to my lord, form k. i don't think, my lord,
in my respectful submission, there can be anything clearer than this my lord.
now form k, which my lord, some part, mr. salve had shown my
lord, but i'm showing something else other than what was shown my lord.
so, this is also a part of the statutory scheme.
this is a statutory form, annexed to a statutory rule, which is a
part of the law made for mineral development and regulation under entry 54.
my lord, please come to page 122, my lord, possibly.
which part of form k? k, k. form k my lords.
122? mineral concession rules, form k. if we have the same my lord?
yes. page 122. 122. my lord, first is, names of the parties.
the state would give and the party would.
please come to the second recital, witnesseth.
your lordships are with me my lords?
my lord, the chief justice are with me?
yes.
witnesseth, now, please note in consideration of rent and royalties, covenants and agreements by
and in these presence and the scheduled here under written, reserved and contained and
on the part of the lessee or lessees' to be paid, observed and performed,
the state government, with the approval of the
central government, hereby grants the demised unto lease.
what is the consideration? the rents and royalties.
further please see the recital, thereafter, my lord.
but first five lines can be skipped except my lord, there is one capital 'except'.
my lord justice pardiwala gets it? yes.
except and reserving out of this demise unto the state government the liberties,
powers and privileges mentioned in part-4 of the said schedule to hold the
premises hereby granted in demise unto the lessee, so and so, so and so years.
then next, ensuing yielding and paying therefrom unto the state government the several rents
and royalties mentioned in part-5 of the said schedule at the respective times therein
specified, subject to provisions contained in part 6 of the said schedule and the lessee.
lessee is hereby covenant with the state government as
in part 7 of the said schedule is expressed.
part 5, 6, 7 does not provide for anything other
than what the lease stipulates, which is what section 13(i) stipulates.
correct, my lords? now kindly turn over the page.
liberties, powers and privileges, to be exercised and enjoyed by
the lessees, subject to the restrictions and conditions in part 3.
nothing turns on that. kindly come to page 127, part 5.
yes part 4. liberties, powers and privileges reserved to the state government.
does your lordship. this is all that is reserved.
it doesn't contain any other power.
this is the law relating to mineral development and
regulation, and i am reading this as a limitation.
because my submission is, it will have to be carved
out, out of the total architecture and not one particular provision.
then your lordships may see part 5.
i'm not reading entire part 4 because except
this there is nothing left with the state government.
they can enter, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
then rents and royalties reserved by this lease.
your lordship has part 5? to pay dead rent or royalty, whichever is higher.
the lessee shall pay for every year except the first year of the
lease, dead rent, as specified in clause 2 of this part, provided that
where the holder of such mining lease becomes liable under section 9 to
pay royalty for any mineral removed or consumed by him or by his
agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee from the leased area, he shall
be liable to pay either such royalty or
the dead rent in respect of that area.
then, my lord. rate and mode of payment of dead rent.
then rate and mode of payment of royalty.
please see 3.
subject to the provisions of clause 1 of this part, the lessee or lessees
shall during the subsistence of the lease pay to the state government at such
times and in such manner as the state government may prescribe royalty in respect
of any mineral or minerals removed by him or them from the leased area
at the rate for the time being specified in
the 2nd schedule to the mines and minerals act.
it does not say that any other taxes, fees, et
cetera, levied by somebody else is covenanted to be paid.
then 4th. the lessee or lessee's shall pay rent.
there is a specific inclusion, which according to me, also
means specific exclusion of anything else other than specific inclusion.
the lessee or lessees shall pay rent and water rate to the state
government in respect of all parts of the surface of the said length
which shall form from time to time be occupied or used by the
lessee or lessees under the authority of these
presence at the rate of so and so.
now kindly see my lord.
most important is part 7, the covenants of the lessee or lessees.
lease to pay rents and royalties, taxes et cetera.
this is very, very important this would perhaps answer your
lordships question and may buttress my submission that whatever is
payable, contemplated to be payable and not limited is provided in this.
clause 1 of part 7.
the lessee, lessees shall pay the rent, water rate and royalties reserved by
these leases at such times and in manner provided in part 5 and
6 of these presents and shall also pay and discharge, please see my
lord, all taxes, rates, assessment and impositions whatsoever being in the nature of
public demands which shall from time to time
be charged.so public demands my lords kindly underline.
assessed by the authority of the central and state government upon
or in respect of premises and works of the lease or lessees.
property tax, revenue, public demand on the premises.
that's the only tax or rate or fee which is permitted.
public demands will have to be read with in respect of premises
and works of the lessee in common, my lord kindly further, with
other premises and works of a like nature, except demand for land revenue.
if my neighbour is paying property tax, i
am under an obligation to pay property tax only.
the only levy outside section 13(i) are these levies.
and this, in my respectful submission, is limitation under entry 50.
my lord only last page 135. the covenants of the state government.
the lessee or lessees paying the rent, water rate and royalties hereby
reserved and observing and performing all the covenants and agreements here in
contained and on the part of the lessee or lessee's to be
observed and performed shall and may quietly hold and enjoy the rights
and premises hereby demised for and during the term, et cetera, et cetera.
this is all that he's supposed to pay.
this can be amended by the central government and my
lord liberty can be given or limitation can be lifted.
i'll put it that way. now, in this context.
solicitor general do have a lip reader also?
i think my lord, this is working, my lord, properly.
oh my god, all the effort to say things silently.
no, no my lord, your lordships were not heard.
i was asking my learned friend, this is separate my lord,
i'm diverging, what justice is so and so is thinking and
your lordships, asked me the question, i thought that this is loud.
no, no, no. mr. solicitor, a form in a statute can't really override
either the statute or can nor it furnish an interpretation of a constitutional entry.
the classical statement was by justice chinnappa reddy in lic vs escorts, where the statutory
form was shown to the court and say that, look, this is what permission means.
it means that prior permission.
justice chinnappa reddy put it very well, he says it was always said by
a judge of the andhra high court in those days that it is that,
dog which wags the tail and not the tail that wags the dog .
your lordships are right.
if the form is the only argument i have, but possibly my lord.
there is a very beautiful extract in lic
vs escorts, on how to construe a statutory form.
my lord, if form is the only argument, i have.
. supreme court 1369 .possibly, my lord the form i am reading, with section 13(i).
section 13(i) says that you can make rules for a,b,c,d,e.
what they want to levy is f,g,h,i.
that's the statute my lord. 13(i), is obviously a statute rule making power.
and the form is not just form used administratively by the government.
it is a statutory form. it has a statutory origin.
now, my lord, i'll read only three or
four paragraphs of justice sinha's dissent in kesoram.
it is a dissent my lord.
and apropos my lord, justice roy's query, i'll read one paragraph.
it's in my written submissions. the constituent assembly debates on this.
possibly, my reading my lord, is otherwise subject to my lord being corrected.
i have examined that. my lords, please come to volume-v, kesoram my lord.
page 2211. volume? v. kesoram dissent. justice, s.b. sinha's dissent, my lord.
page? page 2211. pdf page 2211. para 410.
does your lordship get my lord? which volume?
my lord, it's 2211. it starts at 2020 my lord.
i am at 2211.
i'm reading relevant paras only so that i may not exceed my time.
i know i'm not testing the not patience, but the goodness of your lordships.
what para mr. solicitor? 410. there are only then few passages from two judgments.
para 410, the expression any limitations in entry 50 of list ii
should not be given a restricted meaning, as contended by the appellant.
in fact, the rule of interpretation that the language of entries should be
given widest scope should equally apply to the interpretation of the said words.
so read the limitation, limitations on taxes on mineral rights could be
in any form, including occupying the entire field of legislation under entry
50 of list ii by a parliamentary legislation and providing for levy of taxes.
the mmrda precisely achieves the said objectives by occupying the entire field
of legislation covered by both entry 23 and 50 of list ii.
thereafter, orissa cement is cited, just the last line.
i may read the whole.
section 25 implicitly authorizes the levy of rent, royalty
taxes and fees under the act and the rules.
the scope of powers thus conferred is very wide.
read as a whole the purpose of union control envisaged by entry 54 of
the mmrda is to provide for proper development of mines and mineral areas and
also to bring about uniformity all over the country in regard to the minerals
specified in schedule 1 in the matter of royalties and consequently the prices there
is a view taken by your lordships that
this is a consideration while interpreting the entries also.
then 412 my lords, this objective would be totally defeated by
the impugned levy of cess on coal that has resulted in
coal produced in the state of west bengal, totally unremunerative and uncompetitive.
the price of coal, so producing being much higher than the
price of coal produced in the adjoining state of bihar, up,
odisha, m.p. and maharashtra as shown in the comparative chart below.
your lordships may please ignore that chart.
413, the difference in the ultimate price of coal in the state of
west bengal and other states would thus be around 25% of the base price.
the submission of mr. dwivedi to the effect that the cess
imposed is not excessive, therefore, does not appear to be correct.
from the aforementioned chart, it is evident that no substantial difference can
be culled out so far as the price of coal on dispatch
vis-a-vis at the pithead is concerned in as much as by reason of amendment.
then the court discusses. then kindly come to page 2180.
2180? para 258.
on the economic front, the country has to compete with the lead developed countries.
your lordship gets? developed countries.
global competition has reached such a stage that, despite adequate production of
coal and steel, the same are imported from other countries to india.
this case concerns these two minerals only.
countries to india.
in the international market also, the quantum of
import is going up as compared to export.
the manner in which revenue is collected by the centre and distributed to the states
falls for consideration by the appropriate constitutional authorities in terms of provisions of the constitution.
it is not correct to say that while interpreting the legislative field, the
court, in case of conflict, would lean in favour of the state, keeping
in view the fact that taxes under different heads are collected by the
centre and a part of revenue is made
available to the states from time to time.
this court is not concerned as to whether the centre consumes
the lion's share of the revenue or the same is subject
matter of criticism at the hands of state or financial observers.
such an approach would not only run counter to the doctrine of federalism
with a strong centre, but in the long run would prove to be counterproductive.
india is a signatory to various international treaties and covenants and being a
party to wto and gatt it is obligated to fulfil its transnational obligations.
if, for purpose of giving effect to the international treaties, it in exercise of its
powers under article 253 of the constitution had taken over the legislative field occupied by
list ii of the seventh schedule of the constitution, no exception thereto can be taken.
while doing so, the central government shall give effect to the will of the
makers of the constitution and would not act contrary thereto or an inconsistent therewith.
the legislative fields of union and the state vary from country to country
depending upon the requirement of the situation in which such provisions are made.
although a lot can be said on the subject, keeping in view the fact that
our job is confined to interpretation of legislative entries vis-a-vis the parliamentary and legislative acts.
it may not be necessary to do so, but suffice it to, however point out
that, when such an approach is adopted, we would be more prone to committing errors.
we must proceed on the basis that neither the union nor the
state is supreme in the constitution, as both the union and the
state will have to trace their power from the provisions of the constitution.
we should treat the subject with caution and circumspection.
the interpretative principles, whether leaning in favour of union or the state,
may, in certain situations depend upon the subject matter of legislation, the
importance thereof, and its effect and impact within and outside the country.
both minerals and tea deserve more control only by the
union having regard to their importance in the national economy.
then 261.
distribution of taxes by the central government in favour of state government is
of no moment in the instant case as the entire royalty fixed by
the central government in terms of 1957 act is payable to the states.
the union government has nothing to do therewith.
if the constitution as a living organ is not interpreted having regard to
the intention of the constitution makers and in case of conflict in legislative
field contained in list i and list ii if an interpretation that leans
in favour of the state is adopted without a reference to the subject
matter thereon or national interest, the same would
be subjected to judicial vagaries, which cannot be countenanced.
this is all my lord. just answering my lord's query, i'll just show two things.
a, the constituent assembly debates. this is all i want to say now.
constituent assembly debates.
b, parliamentary debates when this mmrd act was introduced, where it is said
that we want to denude the state from its power and some propositions,
i have quoted the judgments which i'll not read because your lordship have.except two judgments.
one is hind and another judgment on the question what is
the meaning of an ambit in the scope of the term regulation.
my respectful submission would be, regulation would also include a
prohibition against any levy and there are some judgments on that.
if your lordships kindly come to my written submissions, which is 2(f).
my lord justice pardiwala had 2(e). kindly ignore 2(e).
2(f) at page 45. that is my reading.
your lordships reading must be right. but let us read subject to being corrected.
first discussion is on 52 that is similarly worded provision that industries which are
declared by law to be under the control of the parliament in public interest.
52 of volume 2(f)? yes 2(f), page 45.
that's the list of dates? yes. i'm not going to read my lord.
i have just given the list of dates;
i would request your lordships to go through it.
my lord the purpose is to show that historically considering
the very nature of minerals, it has always remained in
the hands of the federal government earlier and central government thereafter.
your lordships have date 31st august, 1949?
my lords have it.
the entries in the union list entry 52, 53 and 54 in the.
i'm sorry my lords. my lord, page number 45, 31st august 49.
this is constituent assembly debates. yes.
the entries in the union list, entry 52, 53 and
54, in the final constitution, and entry 64, 65 and
66 in the draft constitution were debated in the constituent assembly.
the relevant portion of the debate, is as under- honourable dr. ambedkar sir
i move, that entry 64 of list i, the following entry be substituted.
my lord, this is 52. present 52.
sri kamath, mr. president, i move amendment number so and so, of
3rd list, 5th list week, which reads as follows - that in
amendment number 35 of list i, in the proposed entry 64 of
list i, further words the control, the words development and control be substituted.
this was not done. kindly come to the next page.
dr. ambedkar, my lord, somewhere in the middle, my lord, your lordships will find.
that is control of the industry. my lord, justice roy find that?
the honourable doctor br ambedkar sir, the entry as it stands is perfectly
all right, and carries out the intention that the drafting committee has in mind.
my submission is that, once, the centre obtains jurisdiction over
any particular industry, as provided for in this entry, that
industry becomes subject to the jurisdiction of parliament in all its aspects.
my lord, please note, this is entry 52.
similarly worded, that industries which are declared, by law
made by the parliament to be in public interest.
similar to 54. and this is what, my lord, dr. ambedkar.
no. there is one difference between the two.
entry 52 and entry 54. yes.
in entry 52, it is industries, the control of which, by the union is declared.
correct.
but in entry 54, regulation of mines and mineral development,
to the extent to which such is declared by the power.
to the extent, my lord, i'm .
there is a vital difference. 54 is vital.
wider. please see.
regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which,
such regulation and development under the control of the union is declared.
it is, in fact, wider.
but they say that whenever there is a control
conferred by an entry, everything falls within that law.
that's, my lord, my reading of not mere, my lord, kindly
see, become subject of the jurisdiction of parliament, in all its
aspects, not merely development, but it may be in other aspects.
consequently, we have thought that the best thing is.
the control is declared by union, by the
union, are to be expedient in the public interest.
therefore, the dr. ambedkar say that, every aspect of
control is then subsumed, in entry draft entry 54.
that's all, my lord, i wanted to say.
now, my lord, may only allow me to
show, my lord, when this act was enacted.
here we are dealing with limitations. pardon me?
here we are dealing only with limitations, the entirety of the field, once control is.
again, my lord, at the cost of repetition, i'll not.
when the central government takes over the entire control of the industries.
and that control will be all aspects of control.
it's absolute. certainly.
but if we try and find out, my lord, in my
respectful submission, it's a wrong question to ask and therefore we
are not getting the answer, that where is that particular limitation?
the answer is limitation is put by law, not under the law.
by law, the law itself is a limitation.
but i have already addressed, my lord.
i'll not trouble your lordships with that, my lord.
but now, please, my lord, in this very your
lordships are on this, see my lord, page 23.
my lord, this is parliamentary debate when this mmdra work was introduced in 57.
where do we get that? page 23.
same my lord written submissions 23.
my lord only underlined part my lord, i have
underlined certain portions for the sake of saving the time.
a.d. malaviya, would find, only the highlighted part.
i agree with him that, left to ourselves
we should increase the rates of royalty further.
but the rates of royalty cannot go beyond a point.
when in international competition, the price element becomes somewhat against
us, and this is a factor which we cannot ignore.
the moment we increase the royalties beyond a point, it will have
its own repercussion on the total price factor and we cannot ignore it.
this was the intention to put the entire
architecture under the control of the central government.
then this shows that at the time of passing state governments were urged
to look beyond narrow considerations because somebody objected, somebody from the state objected.
and two, the legislators were cognizant of the impact of
royalty on the prices and consequent impact on international market.
please come to page 24. rajendra pratap singh, bihar, page 24.
only the highlighted, black highlighted part.
what we are doing in this bill is to denude the state of
all their powers and responsibilities not only with respect to the minerals mentioned
in schedule 1, which is very comprehensive, but in some respect, we have
even taken away the regulatory powers of the state in respect of all other minerals.
this was the intention behind framing 1957 mmdr act.
that is my respectful submission. my lord kindly see thereafter santosh kumar basu, west bengal.
only the highlighted part.
at the same time -- sometimes i wish the lip
reading could have been a course in the five-year law.
when they are choosing jury members, they have people observing the body
language of the juries, potential juries and depending upon how they are
sitting, how they are sort of gesturing they will say alright he
is a jury to be selected for my part, in my turn.
just in a lighter vein.
solicitor if you are privy to all the conversation which is happening here
for last five days, perhaps the matter would have been over by this time.
that secret keeps us going, it is only that secret with all of us.
that keeps us going. there is still hope.
that was a very potent word. almost divulging, what my lord justice.
but what i said applies to mr. dwivedi also.
i'll not follow that.
kindly my lord go through it, go through the entire parliamentary debate.
what it says is that we cannot have
a narrow state wise understanding of the royalty regime.
whatever is to be done has to be done holistically, nation wise and global wise.
that was the intent and purpose. i'll cite two judgments.
page 62. of volume v? of the very same.
first is hind stone. i would read that first.
it is 63. i'm sorry. page 62.
one minute, i will cite the judgment.
on to page 62 regulation and mineral development and in public interest.
i have cited.62. regulation, mineral development and in public interest.
my lord state of tamil nadu versus hind stone.
this is a leading judgment followed till date on regulation.
please see only the underlined highlighted part.
we do not think that regulation has the rigidity of meaning as never to
take in prohibition much depends on the context in which the expression is used
in the statute and the object sought to be achieved by the contemplated legislation.
i have shown the object.
i have shown the context and in my respectful submission,
regulation of mineral would also include prohibition of any other
kind of levy by anyone except what is stipulated in the act.
then at the foot. this is again a case on minerals.
therefore, a little closer home. yes.
kindly then come to next hind stone, which
was referred in quarry owners association page 63.
it's two or three judge bench. only underlined part.
only underlined part.
the word regulation may have a different meaning in a different context, but
considering it in relation to the economic and social activities including the development
and excavation of mines, ecological and environmental factors, including state's contribution in developing,
manning and controlling such activities, including parting with its wealth, that is the minerals.
the fixation of rate of royalties would also be included within its meaning.
when the law relating to regulation which is the chapter under
which 4 to 9 falls would mean thereafter, my lord, subsequent.
so, in regulating mineral development, the royalty/dead rent is the inherent part of it.
the state has thus before it. state means capital s not the state government.
the state has thus before it, a number of factors
as aforesaid, which would guide it to fix, enhance or
modify the rate of royalty or dead rent payable, by a lessee.
my lord, similar are the judgment, my lord.
i'm not duplicating, but kindly treat them as read, my lord.
in the name of regulation, can the sovereign function or the
sovereign priority to impose a tax be taken away by another sovereign?
if constitution entry permits, yes. therefore. 50 permits then.
.intentionally, the word's uses any limitation. it is not any ban or a total prohibition.
limitation would also include prohibition. limitation means, i restrict you from doing this.
whether by a specific provision, again, my lord, repeating, or by the entire architecture.
my lord, limitation can mean even extinguishment, that i limit you, i restrict you.
limitation doesn't mean that don't charge more than one.
limitation is a very wide term with wide connotation, my lord.
limitation can include, my lord, i'm not on this matter, otherwise also.
limitation, i don't think, other side also argues that limitation cannot lead to prohibition.
it can lead to prohibition.
the prohibition is specific, or you have to
see the entire architecture, that is the question.
then my lord, page 67.
i'm not reading it, just hurriedly going, taking your lordships through.
my lord, hingir-rampur . my lord, i'm not reading it.
mr. salve has taken your lordships throughout all these judgments, till, page 86.
page 85 my lord, sorry. 86, i'm not reading it.
this is my interpretation of judgments from hingir-rampur.
now my lord, the last but one point, my lord, entry 14, my lord,
i'll just make two propositions, because dr. singhvi is arguing on that, my lord,
land at entry 49, my lord, anyway the argument was that, if i do
not fall under entry 50 the text, i can always text under entry 49.
your lordships would recall that. please see entry 49.
my lord, if the argument is true, we will make 50 redundant.
that is number one.
and number two, when there is a specific entry, general entry can never be resorted.
my lord, please see, 50.
my lord, i'm just giving the propositions, my
lord and not taking your lordships time, 50.
taxes on mineral rights, subject to any limitations
imposed by parliament, by law relating to mineral development.
now, 49 comes if they fail in 50.
their argument is, that if we do not have
the competence under 50, then we rely upon 49.
please see 49. taxes on lands and buildings.
if we have no. i'm sorry to interrupt.
but i must clarify. it's not that entry 50 doesn't apply then 49.
it is, entry 49 and if that doesn't apply and you
say because the measure is minerals, there also, my lord, its 50.
that's, it's a reverse. not what you are saying.
as i have shown my lord, first of all,
as i have shown from, my lord, the sub-group.
my lord, this so-called artificial distinction between measure of royalty, namely, in terms
of tons or in terms of area, is now blurred, has always been blurred.
for some minerals, it is on tonnage basis.
for some minerals, it is on the basis of area.
so, it doesn't matter, my lord, whether your mode of taxation is the mineral
itself or the land itself, but the land tax on land and buildings is
a separate entry, not only separately defined, but
the term land would take colour from buildings.
what it provides for is property rights or
something, which deals with land, not anything below that.
another thing, the very fact that for the purpose of taxing,
you have entry 50 and for regulating that very product entry
23 and also 54 in list i, oust my lord 49.
this is my lord an argument of desperation.
my last-ditch argument that if i do not
fall anywhere, anywhere, then i'll fall under 49.
land and building is completely a different subject.
there are two constitution bench judgments.
one is at page 87 waverly jute mills co versus raymon & company.
i'm not reading it. which citation that you said?
page 87? it's a page 87 citation is also given.
yes. 1963 volume 3, scr 209. i'm sorry.
i thought.
the proposition it lays down is one judgment
and underlined portion at page 88 would be enough.
this is waverly jute mills. please see, it follows from this.
your lordships get? underlined portion. my lord justice roy gets?
yes.
it follows from this that where there are two entries, one general in its
character and the other specific the former must be construed as excluding the letter.
this is only an application of general maxim.
the generalis specialibus non derogant.
it is obvious that if entry 26 is to be construed as
comprehending forward contracts, then future markets in entry 48 will be rendered useless.
rest are judgments on the same propositions.
i am not reading, but i would earnestly
request your lordships to just glance through them.
they're really illuminating paragraphs. but it would be unfair on my part to.
now page 91, 'nature of royalty'.
my respectful submission is very categorical and specific and i think
we are ad idem on this both sides for different reasons.
royalty is not a tax.
dr. singhvi may argue, arguendo as an alternative
that is, suppose if it is a tax.
but our case is royalty is not a tax for the
simple reason that for tax you do not need any justification.
if the government is taxing me. there need not be any justification, but in case
of a royalty the government is parting with its sole privilege over the natural resources
and permitting you to exploit it and sell it, and therefore you are paying consideration.
it's not a tax. these are all judgments, which takes the view.
there are judgments.
these are again occupied field in the lighter vein
by the judgment, that royalty is not a tax.
but i would say. but in india cements, the question was tax on royalty, correct.
royalty is not tax. cess on royalty.
cess or tax imposed on royalty.
my answer is, my lord i'm couching my statement very accurately.
for the purpose of section 9, royalty is not a tax.
why i say this? there is a reason.
we have filed an affidavit on behalf of ministry of petroleum and natural
gas, for petroleum and natural gas, which are also minerals there is a
separate entry, namely entry 53 and there is a separate set of acts.
there are two acts.
there my lord the concerned public sector undertaking is taking
a stand that it is a tax, which it can
take because entry is different and the statutory scheme is different.
but so far as section 9 is concerned and the architecture of mmdra
is concerned, the royalty on minerals covered by mmdra is not a tax.
if your lordship would like to write it down.
volume iii(g) is the affidavit of the mopng.
my lord, i must say that initially both minerals and petroleum, that is called mineral
oil were under the same regime of 48 act, but thereafter specifically, even the statement
of objects and reasons of mmdra says that now we are having a separate regime.
therefore, we have filed this affidavit so that the psus can
take a different stand and that may perhaps be a justifiable stand.
these are my respectful submissions. i have prepared propositions.
i may revise it and file it by tomorrow, so
that your lordships may get what are my legal propositions?
it is available.
i have also uploaded but during the course of the
hearing i would like to make some changes for your lordship.
certainly. privileged to assist. thank you.
i had also revised a lot of things which
in the course of submissions, would your lordships would.
may i give a written note of finally, as how the matter was presented?
if you want to, but we have taken very elaborate notes.
very well. yes dr. singhvi. i have a written note.
it gives the civil appeals where i am appearing.
kesoram and others. the numbers are given there.
i'll take your lordships through it. at the outset, let me say this.
the advantage or disadvantage of a nine-judge bench is that, your lordship,
though not on a tabular rasa are not bound by any landscape.
so, whatever your lordship does is what is most persuasive or on first principle.
so, we will cite cases, but they are only
intended to be persuasive this way or that way.
neither seven judges nor five judges.
your lordships will find some useful reasoning in some cases which
is why we will deal with those cases in that sense.
secondly my lords, almost every argument of mine is without prejudice in
the alternative and assuming that the arguments already made do not succeed.
because if they succeed your lordship doesn't need to reach many of my arguments.
and that's the way it should be done because the nine-judge bench is laying down
law for a pretty long time if everyone is going to be reconsidered and your
lordship should have all the perspectives and should deal with them because you should not
really be leaving holes to be discussed again and then again, some new reference comes.
thirdly, my lords will your lordship will always keep in mind a
general view, a general question which i want to ask again and again.
ultimately, all this is being done, all these exertions are being done because of kesoram.
and my humble respectful submission, is my question to myself is
that, there has to be something very special about kesoram's correctness.
for your lordships to go in that direction or adopt that view.
because according to me, kesoram, apart from all that other debate
about five judges, touching on seven judges, not referring it to
nine judges, but themselves deciding et cetera, that is a separate debate.
my lords, kesoram, what is so wrong with india cements.
and conversely, what is so special and right about kesoram, that my
lords, use a phrase, not irreverently, it says- 'the cat amongst the
pigeons', on a certain corpus of law, which has been going on and on.
and that question, whether i believe is not
satisfactory answered, because kesoram really does an ipse dixit.
now, my lords, i have done this, my lords, the other thing about nine
judges by the time we reach the third or the fourth person, we have
to take our original written submission and chisel them down, cut off what is covered.
so that's what i've done.
because, i've tried to chisel them into six propositions,
which remain, and they are mostly in the alternative.
they are right on the top of my submissions, which
your lordships, i'm told gets at volume ii(e), page 305.
i'm going to only stick to those six propositions, and everything,
my lords, including case law, my lord, relevant portions are quoted there.
so that, my lords, speed will be assisted.
my lords, will not have to spend.
i'm told, my lords, is volume ii(e), page 305.
it's been loaded. yes.
and as i said my lords, these submissions are not in any manner to detract.
they are only to reinforce an alternative view.
and i think your lordships should have, your lordships, in
a sense, forget what has gone in the past and
now my lords, kindly see an alternative view, to some extent.
the first is, my lords, royalty is a tax
and/or qualifies as an impost and compulsory exaction under 366(28).
in my submissions, i've pinpointed the paras dealing with this,
b(1) to b(32) and the page is 21 to 32.
so, your lordships has exactly where i've dealt
with this, with the extracts and the quotations.
it just fell as the mr. mehta ended
fell from my lord, justice nagarathna, india cements.
india cements, my lords, directly holds it to be a tax.
it then says, a cess is also a tax.
it's a tax on tax. para 34, i'll come to that.
there's no india cements or kesoram binding, whether it's seven or five.
but what is my lords? we see the intrinsic worth of the reasoning.
it's not wrong.
so, the first is, whether is, royalty is a tax and qualifies,
and my more consider second part of the sentence, impost compulsory execution,
et cetera, and the test of a constitutional article not merely a statute.
my second submission as well is, and i don't
think enough of this weight has been given to that.
a second very important levy.
it may be a little less, in quantum term, very important levy.
dead rent, is clearly of course, based on acreage, and
being a tax, clearly a tax, is directly occupied by 9(a).
not 9, 9(a). the paras are given b (29) to (32), (31) to (32).
this tax is a tax on mineral rights.
unlike my fourth argument, which is a little
different, this is a tax on mineral rights.
the third, of course, although your lordships dealt with
it, i'm going to be doing a little addition here.
entry 97 and the reasoning will go, my
lords, if i may just summarize the reasoning.
entry 50 itself recognizes a taxing limitation, by parliament.
your lordships, will be looking at the second part of 50.
your lordships sees the opening word its taxes.
the limitation must include limitations of taxation.
has to. otherwise, the section can't be read properly.
i mean, the entry can't be read properly.
i'm just summarizing my point 3, because i'm developing data and just summarizing.
so, step one, entry 50, recognizes taxing power of parliament itself in its own entry.
second, it recognizes a limitation on that taxing entry
on itself, because of a parliamentary superior taxing right.
third, it then says, that therefore my lords, i'll be excluded, it can only
be by combined application, because this tax you're talking about of 54 read with 97.
because taxing is specifically dealt with in 97.
now my lord's query which i will be dealing with, namely 248(2).
tax covered, otherwise not specified any of the two?
the moment it is specified. 248 (2).
no. it's really formulating 248(2). that's the query my lords put.
248(2) is otherwise not specified. entry 50 specifies a taxing limitation itself.
but, therefore, such a tax has to fall under entry 54.
it can't fall. read with 97.
an entry which has been forgotten, dealt with three of your lordships cases.
it cannot ever fall in entry 97 because it
is tax which is specified in one of the decisions.
entry 54 and 97 read conjointly, read with the third factor
a limitation in 50 itself, recognizing the taxing power of parliament.
the three things add up to create this proposition.
that's why i said it's a little different, i've developed it.
this is three things. the synergy of three things.
but if there is a limitation on the taxing power of the state.
50.
that does not mean that the entire subject
is transferred to parliament to levy a tax.
it is my lord.
if parliament chooses, as it does in section 15, to
say, for minor minerals, you, the state can do it.
it is different otherwise it is entirely with parliament.
parliament chooses not to say it in section 13.
entire field of levy of tax on mineral rights is with the states.
that power is subject to limitation, which parliament may impose by law.
the word limitation starts with a taxing limitation.
see the entry. i'm going ahead of my own story.
just see, the entry. 50 says taxes on so and so, including limitations.
the primary limitation has to be a taxing limitation.
it is dealing with -- in fact, 50 is a
recognition of parliamentary superiority in taxation, apart from other things.
but in hs dhillon, this court has said, if a taxation entry
is absent in list i, or list 2, then it can be entry.
that's exactly what mahalakshmi says. that's exactly what five judgment your lordships says.
but we have all seen from the last two three weeks.
we are seeing the taxation entry in entry 50.
my lords, with respect is that private law example very lose example.
wrong example of . it's a circle.
your lordships know of in private international law.
it's a circle. 50, you start with.
50, recognizes the superiority of parliament, especially in taxation.
this last three words have been less emphasized.
that superiority of parliament in taxation then gets completely coalesced and developed by
a conjoint reading of 54 with 97 because 50 subordinates itself in taxation.
qua parliamentary taxation.
what entry 50 recognizes is that the taxes on mineral rights can
be imposed only by the state legislature since it's in the state list.
but while doing so, you are subject to
a limitation which parliament may impose by law.
that is not to say that the moment parliament imposes a limitation
that whole field is then transferred to the taxing power of the union.
that is mr. salve's and mr. mehta's argument.
i'm now doing a totally different, nuanced argument.
that first part your lordship has, totally occupied, et cetera, i am not dedicating.
that they succeed, if your lordship holds it this way, that matter ends
my lord, this way or that way, now, i am saying something in addition.
that's why i said this is separate.
one is occupation. it clearly does.
actually, the rest of my written submission has the submissions.
i'm not giving your lordships those submissions at all.
my argument is that forget the occupation doctrine.
may i do it when i come to
the third proposition, rather than do it now.
if your lordships will read the entry itself, i'll develop it from there.
let me just finish the propositions first.
so that's my third proposition, and that is dealt
with in para 8 to 32, pages 5 to 15.
now the fourth proposition is, of course, i must emphasize, wholly in the alternative.
your lordship has been dealing till now with mineral rights.
ask a simple question my lords: regulation and mineral development is the word in 54.
if they didn't want the words to be
different, why did they use mineral rights in 50?
the answer is also answered by your lordships.
all these cases have not been given meaning and importance by my lords kesoram,
and many of them have been noticed not only justice sinha, but in other judgments.
why is it that 50 uses mineral rights whereas 54 uses,
if they wanted to give the entire space, the entire universe,
they would have used the same words as 54 in 50.
or they would have used the words of 23 in 50.
23 is a mirror image of 54, which
is why your lordship has always held denudation.
they use mineral rights because it's a very narrow area given.
so, my fourth submission is, your lordship should lay down in
this judgment because we don't come to 9 judges again and again.
your lordship does not want chaos in the law.
the difference between tax on minerals versus tax on mineral rights.
the two are different. your lordship will only lay down guidelines.
the division benches will decide whether the impost
in question falls this side or that side.
but your lordship must lay down guidelines because take a simple example, my lease
or license to him of 10 years, 15 years, 100 years can be taxed.
that's a tax on mineral rights.
it is very different from taxing the quantum of mineral extracted on tonnage or sale.
that is conceptually different. the language is different.
the advisory the constitution uses different language.
please don't equate tax on minerals with tax on mineral rights.
that's my fourth proposition.
my lord my fifth case, the alternative which is, again not been argued.
it is a clarification which is important from nine judges, that today we
leave this court after arguing all this tax this way, tax that way.
tomorrow my lord the states get up and say, that was the case deciding tax.
oh, but i have the power to levy the
same thing as similar things on the ground of fee.
now your lordship has held very clearly that if
23 is denuded, then the power eclipse.not denuded, eclipsed.
then the power to levy fees on concomitantly in 66 cannot be
there because 66 operates only if the main power is in 23.
that's my fifth proposition.
that clarification should be clear that we don't restart the
whole litigation on by different names called some fees being levied.
if 23 is gone now my lords why it
is important also is, kesoram has a loose paragraph.
with great respect i say so, all fiscal levies.
whether all fiscal levies include fees or not your lordships should clarify.
if there is no 23 powers in list ii,
there cannot be a 66 power to levy fees.
and all states are levying fees relying on that para of kesoram.
110(2) i shall come to all these details.
that's my fifth proposition.
how much of entry 23 list ii is denuded is the question?
my lords fees can't operate, no entry 23 list ii.
identical language of 54 and 23. the denudation must be completed.
and what will happen is. i understand my lords query.
this is more the occupation argument.
so, what will happen is, the parliament, the
framers use same language in 54 and 23.
now my lords parliament passes a law about a coat, a gown, a band.
it is then said that the state can tax the pant and the shoes.
my lords parliament has evinced an intention that we will tax only the
coat and the gown and the band and implied in its parliament's reticence
and hesitation and prohibition on itself not to tax the trousers and the shoes.
your lordship will not read the entry 23 in a manner that if
it is exercised and you my lords, the chair example is limited valuables.
in lighter vein mr. mehta seems to have taken
chief justice's advice, he moved me one chair further.
as he occupied my chair also.
i'm worried that he follows your lordships advice too literally.
but the answer to my lords justice nagarathna's very important query is that
the occupation is not that your lordship will then encourage piecemeal legislation by
parliament and say that you are not able to occupy because you intended to occupy.
because the intention of parliament is that we believe in
our wisdom that only the coat and gown must be taxed.
but the subject matter is the same that can't be disputed.
in entry 66 is one advantage i have something to your lordships kind discretion.
66 is entirely dependent on 23.
now 23 and 54, fortunately, have identical or virtually identical language.
then the denudation will not operate.
in my coat and trousers example on only how far the taxation has gone.
then it will not. that's my submission.
and the last one, is very interesting.
i have a self-contained note which i may not read, it is about nine pages.
it gives ten fundamental reasons.
three of them, why there is no typo in india, cements as
contended by as found by kesoram and seven other patent errors of kesoram.
your lordships, will see only two two lines of that.
i will read out of those ten pages, one page, one and a half pages.
for example, kesoram says that- india cements cites two high court judgments.
but does not follow four other high courts
the other way and therefore, india cements is wrong.
actually, what india cements does is, it cites those two.
it cites the other four and says, we prefer these two.
a point which kesoram completely misses or my lords, in fact overlooked it.
alright, dr. singhvi, now. we can now start one by one.
we are just at 4:55 now. we'll continue tomorrow.
i will finish well in time, mr. ganguly will get enough time.
don't worry. who follows dr. singhvi now?
mr. khambata will.
i, if your lordships permit, i would like to address
for an hour or so if your lordships permit me?
so, mr. khambata, dr. singhvi then mr. after me my lord, mr. ganguly is there.
mr. ganguly will argue. mr. bagaria. my lord, i'll take 15 minutes, my lord.
there is a. everyone has to finish by lunch.
dr. singhvi we will give 10:30 to.
3 o' clock make it.
mr. dwivedi will get the full of thursday and some part of tomorrow also.
dr. singhvi, what we'll do is this.
we'll give you 30 to 11:15. we will give mr ganguly, 11:15 to 11:45.
mr. bagaria, 11:45 to 12:15. mr. khambata, 12:15 to 12:45 and 15 minutes for you.
that's it. only one thing. seeing the nature.
allow me at least 1 hour.
otherwise, it won't be fair, my lord, on the submissions.
in dalmia cements, ordered by three judge bench, where they referred
six questions and directed it to be tagged along with this.
now my lord, my submission is i'm going to request your lordships,
those out of the six only one relates to nature of royalty.
the remaining five can be kept separately subsoil right who wants the minerals, et cetera.
so, i have made a powerpoint presentation, and i'll
just take eight to ten minutes, about six slides.
i have to show to your lordships.
you want that to be de-tagged with.
i have to make. .except on the royalty.
on the royalty issue. i'm not submitting.
and to save time, i made a powerpoint presentation.
i think that should be de-tagged, my lords.
that should be de-tagged. i have a similar request.
no, no, no. subsoil can be de-tagged?
ongc also de-tagged yeah. ongc oil.
so, you can tell us which are the matters to be de-tagged.
i think on this there should be no dispute.
mr. dwivedi, mr. datar and the learned solicitor general, please give the court
master by tomorrow morning, the list of matters which have to be de-tagged.
mr datar, we will de-tag your matter as well on royalty since we have
heard arguments on what is the nature of royalty, we can take a small note.
i've just a submit on entry 50, as to what is this.
what i've made the submission on, my lord, i've said that
the levy in entry 50 talks of tax on mineral rights.
tax has three components: levy, assessment, collection.
levy is taken away by 9, 9(a), 9(b).
so, i've made a chart. so only levy is taken.
give us the chart. we have given you the.
one second, we've given you the bottom line.
all learned counsel have to put their heads
together, so that you finish by lunch tomorrow.
absolutely no question of going ad nauseam.
we will never finish otherwise.
this will go on to next week and we have another matter next week.
the other submission we are made in the context of mining lease.
my lord, mining lease is normally for a
particular area, 20 sq kms, 40 sq kms.
so, we had drawn a map. tamil nadu's goal is entry 49.
alright, we'll delink your matters mr. datar.
no, mine only on royalty. mining lease is only entry 50.
we'll give you five minutes to hear your arguments on royalty.
. some moment. i'll cut one hour from my argument.
allow me till 45, mr. datar. dr. singhvi, we have no difficulty.
anybody who feels that, everybody has to decide now,
that well, who's going to take how much time?
but no difficulty. sorry we will not do that.
whoever remains written submissions. mr. dwivedi you start at 2:00 and you conclude at 4:00.
give us thursday my lords, we will not go beyond thursday, my lords.
your lordships, gave me one day, my lords.
but it's going to affect all mineral rights.
but adding zeros doesn't change the legal principle.
the principle is always the same, irrespective of the
number of zeros and decimal places added to it.
my lords, i have given 15. can we give five minutes, my lords.
i have counted 32. my name is there in serial number.
if you want main aap sabko hindi mein samjha sakta hoon.
aap sab shaam ko baith lijiye, tay kar lijiye, do
ghante mein, dhai ghante mein, subha aap sabko tay karna hai.
bahas iss taraf. 02:00 we are putting mr. dwivedi in.
this will never get over otherwise. thank you.
